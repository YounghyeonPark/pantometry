//! pantometry-acoustic: sound, as a domain on the `pantometry-core` kernel.
//!
//! The linear wave equation on a grid, in one dimension, two or three:
//!
//! - [`Tube`] — a duct, a rod, an organ pipe — with ends that can be open, closed, or matched to
//!   a different medium. Modes are a harmonic series, `n·c/2L`.
//! - [`Room`] — a floor plan, where the modes stop being a series and start being a lattice.
//! - [`Hall`] — with a ceiling. The vertical and oblique modes exist here and **do not exist at
//!   all** in a `Room`; a 2.4 m ceiling puts the first one at 71 Hz, well inside the range a
//!   room is judged on.
//!
//! The three are not a progression to be climbed. Each dimension costs the cells and `√d` in the
//! Courant limit on top, so a `Room` is the right model for a floor plan and a `Tube` for a duct.
//! `Hall` is for the question the other two cannot answer rather than the one they answer more
//! cheaply.
//!
//! ```text
//! ∂²p/∂t² = c² ∂²p/∂x²
//! ```
//!
//! # Why this domain and not a fluid one
//!
//! Sound is what a fluid does when nothing much is happening: small pressure
//! variations about a resting state, where the governing equations linearise and every
//! answer has a closed form to check against. Standing modes in a tube are `n c/2L`
//! exactly. A reflection off an impedance step is `(Z₂-Z₁)/(Z₂+Z₁)` exactly. A pulse
//! travels at `c` and arrives when it should.
//!
//! Full Navier-Stokes has far less of that: turbulence at any interesting Reynolds number is
//! a question about supercomputer budgets rather than about API design. The incompressible
//! solver is `pantometry-fluid`, built around the three exact solutions that exist; this crate
//! is the linear limit, and it is complete rather than partial.
//!
//! # The fourth domain, and what it had to add to the kernel
//!
//! Nothing. That is the claim the crate split was for, and this is the fourth time it
//! has held: optics, heat, mechanics and now sound, none of them naming another and
//! none of them needing the kernel changed.
//!
//! What it does exercise for the first time is a **[`Kind::Evolving`] domain whose
//! stability limit is a genuine CFL condition** — `dt ≤ dx/c`, from a wave speed rather
//! than from a diffusion coefficient or a spring. Going past it does not degrade the
//! answer, it explodes within a handful of steps, so the limit is reported and the step
//! is refused rather than attempted.

// Every public item carries a doc comment. Denied rather than warned: a public physics API
// whose `Length::mm` shows a blank summary in rustdoc is documented in the sense that a
// paragraph exists somewhere, and not in the sense a reader needs.
