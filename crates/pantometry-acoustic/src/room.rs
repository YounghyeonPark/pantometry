//! Sound in two dimensions: a room rather than a tube.
//!
//! [`Tube`](crate::Tube) is one-dimensional, which covers a duct and an organ pipe and
//! nothing with a shape. A room has modes in every direction at once, and they interact
//! in a way a one-dimensional model cannot show: the frequencies are not a harmonic
//! series, they crowd together as they rise, and the low ones are far enough apart to be
//! heard individually as the boom a small room has at one particular note.
//!
//! # The closed form, which is exact and not obvious
//!
//! A rectangular room with rigid walls resonates at
//!
//! ```text
//! f(nx, ny) = (c/2) √((nx/Lx)² + (ny/Ly)²)
//! ```
//!
//! for every pair of non-negative integers. Two things follow that a tube does not show.
//! The series is not harmonic — `f(1,1)` is not a whole multiple of `f(1,0)` — so a room
//! does not ring on a note, it rings on a chord that is not one. And the modes get denser
//! as the frequency rises, going as `f²` in two dimensions rather than staying evenly
//! spaced, which is why a room's colouration is audible at the bottom of the spectrum and
//! not at the top.
//!
//! # What this shares with the tube, and what it does not
//!
//! The same staggered scheme, extended: pressures at cell centres, velocities on the
//! faces between them in each direction. The CFL condition tightens, and by a factor that
//! is worth knowing — `dt ≤ dx/(c√2)` in two dimensions rather than `dx/c`, because a
//! wave travelling diagonally covers `√2` cells while crossing one. In three dimensions
//! it would be `√3`. Every explicit wave solver pays that, and it is the reason
//! three-dimensional acoustics is expensive rather than merely large.

/// first order in time; this is a plane of nodes governed by one that is second order. They
/// disagree in three ways that are worth writing down, because a visualiser will meet all
/// three.
///
/// # `rate` needs the velocity, not the Laplacian
///
/// For diffusion the governing equation gives `∂T/∂t = α∇²T`, so the field's own curvature
/// *is* its rate of change and one array answers everything. A wave is second order:
/// `∂²p/∂t² = c²∇²p`. The Laplacian gives the acceleration, and the *rate* comes from the
/// companion velocity field instead — `∂p/∂t = −ρc²∇·u`, which this scheme stores on the
/// faces and which [`Domain::step`] uses verbatim.
///
/// So both domains can report an exact rate from their present state and neither needs
/// history, but by different routes. The general statement is the useful one: a marched
/// domain can answer `rate` whenever its stored state is enough to evaluate the governing
/// equation, which is the same condition as being well posed as a first-order system. It is
/// not a property of diffusion.
///
/// # The gradient really is zero at these walls
///
/// The thermal crate's `Bar1D` — named in prose rather than linked, because these two
/// domains do not depend on each other and rustdoc rightly refuses to pretend otherwise —
/// uses a cell-centred grid, which puts its first sample half a cell
/// inside the wall, where the temperature is still changing, so a gradient reported there is
/// not zero. This grid is node-centred: a node sits *on* the wall, and a rigid wall's
/// boundary condition is exactly `∂p/∂n = 0`. Mirroring gives `(p₁ − p₁)/2dx`, which is zero
/// to the last bit.
///
/// Neither is a mistake. The difference is where the samples are, and that is the kind of
/// thing only a second implementor could have shown.
///
/// # And the values are signed
///
/// A temperature is positive and climbs; a pressure swings either side of zero and averages
/// out. Any colour map worth having for this one is diverging with a fixed midpoint, and one
/// built for temperature will draw a room as though half of it were cold. That is a
/// requirement on a renderer that a single monotonic field would never have surfaced.
///
/// # One sharp edge to know about
///
/// `at` interpolates between nodes; `gradient`, `laplacian` and `rate` snap to the nearest
/// one, because they are the scheme's own stencils and the scheme only has values at nodes.
/// So combining them at an arbitrary point — `laplacian(p) / at(p)`, say — divides a number
/// computed at one place by one computed at another. Sample on a node when the ratio
/// matters. The same is true of any field backed by a grid.
