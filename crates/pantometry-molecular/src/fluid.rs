//! A Lennard-Jones fluid, as a domain the kernel can step.
//!
//! # What is being claimed, and how it is checked
//!
//! Every other domain in this workspace is checked against a value: a Fresnel coefficient, a
//! mode frequency, a temperature rise. This one mostly cannot be. A hundred atoms bouncing off
//! each other have no closed-form trajectory and are chaotic besides — two runs differing in
//! the last bit of one coordinate diverge completely inside a few hundred steps, and that is
//! the physics rather than a numerical failing.
//!
//! What *is* exact is what the trajectory averages to, and there is plenty of it:
//!
//! - **Equipartition.** `⟨KE⟩ = (3N − 3) k_BT / 2`, and the `−3` is not a rounding: momentum is
//!   conserved, so the centre of mass never moves and three degrees of freedom are frozen.
//!   Using `3N` overstates the temperature by `1/N`, which is a percent at a hundred atoms and
//!   is the classic way to be quietly wrong.
//! - **The ideal gas law.** At low density the virial term dies and `PV = Nk_BT` exactly.
//! - **The virial theorem.** At any density, `PV = Nk_BT + ⟨Σ f·r⟩/3`, which is the definition
//!   of the pressure rather than an approximation of it.
//! - **Energy conservation.** With no thermostat this is a symplectic integrator on a
//!   conservative system, so the total is bounded rather than drifting — the same statement
//!   [`velocity_verlet`](pantometry_core::velocity_verlet) is checked for on a harmonic oscillator,
//!   holding here for a many-body potential.
//! - **Maxwell-Boltzmann.** Once thermostatted, the speeds settle into a distribution whose
//!   mean and variance are both fixed by one temperature.
//!
//! # Determinism, in a domain built out of random numbers
//!
//! The initial velocities and every Langevin kick come from
//! [`Rng::for_index`](pantometry_core::Rng::for_index), keyed by step and particle. So the noise is
//! a pure function of `(seed, step, particle)` and a run is reproducible whatever order the
//! work is done in — which is the property the kernel's generator was built for and the one a
//! chaotic system makes impossible to recover any other way.
