//! A stress-free strain, and the four closed forms that catch four different ways of getting it
//! wrong.
//!
//! An **eigenstrain** is the size a body would take if nothing held it: `αΔT` for thermal
//! expansion, and the same statement for swelling, curing shrinkage or a phase change. The domain
//! is deliberately not told which, so it never has to depend on whatever computes the temperature.
//!
//! Trilinear elements reproduce any linear displacement field exactly, and a uniform eigenstrain
//! produces one — so **every case here is exact at any mesh size**, not converging. That is what
//! makes the tolerances machine epsilon rather than a judgement, and it is why a wrong factor
//! cannot hide behind a coarse grid.
