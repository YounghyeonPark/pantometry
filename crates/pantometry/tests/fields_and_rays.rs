//! Where the wave picture and the ray picture have to agree.
//!
//! `pantometry-optics` computes a surface's reflectance from Fresnel's equations — algebra on two
//! refractive indices. `pantometry-em` marches Maxwell on a grid and knows nothing about either. The
//! two crates share no code at all; they do not even depend on each other.
//!
//! So a reflectance that comes out the same from both is a real check, and it is the only kind of
//! check that says the two are limits of one physics rather than two unrelated models that happen
//! to be in the same workspace.
//!
//! # What makes a plane wave statable in a box
//!
//! A wave along `z` polarised along `y` has `Ey` **tangential** to the `x` faces, so a conducting
//! wall there would force it to zero and turn the plane wave into a waveguide mode — with a cutoff,
//! a different phase velocity, and a reflectance that is a function of both. Conductors on the `y`
//! faces and *magnetic* conductors on the `x` ones leave the wave exactly uniform, and the `z`
//! faces absorb so nothing comes back to be counted twice.
