//! Where scalar diffraction is right, and where a field solution says it is not.
//!
//! `pantometry-optics` gives a slit's far field as `sinc²(π a sinθ/λ)`. That rests on **Kirchhoff's**
//! boundary condition: the field in the opening is taken to be the incident field, and zero on the
//! screen. Maxwell's equations do not say that. The metal carries currents, the field in the opening
//! is perturbed near its edges over a distance of order `λ`, and the fraction of the aperture that
//! is wrong therefore goes as `λ/a`.
//!
//! So the two agree in a limit and not otherwise, and this measures where. `pantometry-em` marches the
//! actual field, the aperture plane is transformed to the far field, and the result is compared with
//! the formula at four slit widths.
//!
//! Measured as the largest absolute difference in intensity, normalised to the axis:
//!
//! ```text
//!   a = 12λ    0.0057     the formula is right
//!   a =  6λ    0.0125
//!   a =  3λ    0.0311
//!   a =  1λ    0.2772     it is wrong by more than a quarter of the pattern it predicts
//! ```
//!
//! A factor of 48 from one wavelength to twelve, monotone — which is what says the disagreement is
//! Kirchhoff's condition and not something that happens to be large at one width.
//!
//! **Not all of the smallest number is Kirchhoff's.** At 12 and 10 cells per wavelength the 12λ
//! figure is 0.0065 and 0.0067 against this table's 0.0057 at 16, and read as `e₀ + c·h²` that
//! puts roughly a fifth of 0.0057 in the grid. The rate is still the physics — the fall is 44× at
//! 12 cells and 40× at 10, every assertion below holds at both — but the table's last row is an
//! upper bound on the Kirchhoff error rather than a measurement of it. Sixteen cells is kept for
//! that reason: at twelve the grid's share of that row would be nearer 30%.
//!
//! # How the far field is got out of a small box
//!
//! Not by making the box big enough to be in the far field — that would be `a²/λ` deep, hundreds of
//! wavelengths for a wide slit. Instead the tangential field is recorded on a plane just past the
//! screen and Fourier transformed:
//!
//! ```text
//!   E(θ) ∝ ∫ E(x) e^{−i k x sinθ} dx
//! ```
//!
//! which **is** the Fraunhofer limit, exactly. The box only has to be deep enough to hold the screen
//! and a wavelength behind it, and wide enough that the diffracted near field has not reached the
//! side walls by the time it crosses the recording plane.
//!
//! # What makes a plane wave possible next to a screen
//!
//! Magnetic conductors on the `x` faces. A wave along `z` polarised along `y` has `Ey` tangential
//! there, so an electric conductor would force it to zero and there would be no plane wave to
//! diffract. The mirror images that a magnetic wall implies would make this a grating rather than a
//! slit — but the transform integrates over **one** box width, and the neighbouring slits lie outside
//! it, so what is transformed is this slit's aperture field and no other's.
