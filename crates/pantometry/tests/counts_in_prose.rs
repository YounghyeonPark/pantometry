//! Counts spelled out in prose, against the thing they count.
//!
//! `friction_counts.rs` checks `FRICTION.md`'s own summary sentence against its headings, and that count
//! has not been wrong since. What it does not check is the **six other places** the same total is
//! restated, and a `prose-auditor` pass before the 0.14.0 release found four of them saying twenty-three
//! when the file said twenty-four. Three more documents said fourteen or eighteen scenes when there were
//! twenty-one.
//!
//! Six of that audit's twenty findings were this one shape: a number of scenes or findings written into a
//! document nothing compares against anything. That is a *class*, and a correction closes one instance of
//! it while a test closes the class.
//!
//! # Exact phrases, and why the first design was worse
//!
//! The first version scanned for any number-word near a subject word — "N scenes", "N findings" — and
//! compared every one against the total. It fired three times immediately and **all three were its own
//! fault**: `scenes/README.md` legitimately says "the first of three scenes with nothing to draw", and
//! `AGENTS.md` legitimately says "twelve worked problems" about fifteen example files, because three of
//! them are a quickstart, a benchmark and a README checker rather than worked problems. Subset counts and
//! differently-defined counts are normal prose and a blunt scan cannot tell them from staleness.
//!
//! I had also predicted the wrong failure mode for that design — written down as "the risk is a false
//! pass" — and what it produced was three false failures.
//!
//! So each claim is registered as a **template** with the number left as `{}`, and the test asserts two
//! things: the template filled with the right word is present, and filled with any *other* number-word it
//! is not. That has no false positives, and rewording a sentence makes the test fail with "not found"
//! rather than pass silently — which is the property that matters, because a vacuous pass is how this
//! class of staleness survives in the first place.
