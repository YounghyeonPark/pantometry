//! `CITATION.cff` parses, and every field Zenodo needs is the shape it needs.
//!
//! This file exists because the v0.13.0 deposition **failed**. Zenodo read `CITATION.cff`, rejected
//! it, and reported nothing beyond a red "Failed" on a web page — the release went to crates.io and
//! PyPI and got no DOI, and nothing in the repository could have caught it first.
//!
//! The cause was one line: `license: MIT OR Apache-2.0`. That is a valid SPDX *expression* and this
//! workspace's `Cargo.toml` is right to use it, but CFF's schema takes an identifier or a list of
//! them, and an expression matches neither. The correct form is a two-element list.
//!
//! # Why this is a Rust test and not a CI step with a Python validator
//!
//! Because the failure was a *field shape*, and the four checks below catch that class without a
//! dependency. `cffconvert` would be stricter and would also be one more thing to install, and this
//! crate is where the repository already keeps its documentation-consistency tests —
//! `friction_counts.rs` next door checks that a prose count matches the headings it counts.
//!
//! What this cannot check is the whole CFF schema. It checks the parts that broke and the parts a
//! release depends on, which is the difference between a test and a wish.

/// validates clean against the CFF 1.2.0 schema — `cffconvert --validate` says so — and Zenodo rejected
/// that too, because Zenodo stores exactly one licence per record and a list is not one.
///
/// And this test asserted the list. It was written to lock in the first fix and it locked in the
/// specification of the second failure instead, which is the shape this workspace has named before:
/// **a test that encodes what the implementation does rather than what the consumer needs.** Validating
/// against the schema was never the requirement; being acceptable to Zenodo was, and the two are
/// different.
