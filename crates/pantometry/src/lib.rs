//! pantometry: physics for simulated worlds, in one dependency.
//!
//! A facade over the workspace. Nothing is implemented here — the point is that a
//! consumer writes `pantometry = "0.20"` rather than naming eleven crates, and that the
//! integration tests which need two domains at once have somewhere to live.
//!
//! ```
//! use pantometry::prelude::*;
//!
//! // A lamp, a filter, and the question that needs both.
//! let lamp = SpectralPower::new(
//!     Spectrum::blackbody(3200.0),
//!     Power::w(1.0),
//!     VISIBLE_RANGE,
//! );
//! let green = Spectrum::bands(vec![[500.0, 560.0]], 0.95, 0.0);
//! let through = lamp.through(&green);
//! assert!(through < lamp.total());
//! ```
//!
//! # Start here
//!
//! Three ideas carry the whole library.
//!
//! 1. **Units are types.** Dimensions live in the type, so `Length + Time` does not compile.
//!    One place may hold a factor of a thousand — a unit-bearing constructor — and `to_si()`
//!    is the only way back to a bare `f64`.
//! 2. **A domain is anything that steps.** [`Domain`](pantometry_core::Domain) requires
//!    `name` and `step`; everything else has a default. Override `ledger` so the audit has
//!    something to check.
//! 3. **Domains never call each other.** They meet on
//!    [`Exchange`](pantometry_core::Exchange), a bus of named channels carrying SI *amounts* —
//!    joules, not watts. A ledger says what you are holding, not what has passed through you.
//!
//! And the reason to pick this over a general-purpose engine: conservation is audited every
//! step, so a wrong model does not run quietly. `advance` returns a
//! [`Violation`](pantometry_core::Violation) naming the quantity, the site, and the before and
//! after — a correctness signal you can act on without a human noticing first.
//!
//! ```text
//! energy destroyed at simulation: 5.000000e2 became 4.995000e2,
//! a relative change of 1.000e-3 against a tolerance of 1.000e-9
//! ```
//!
//! Be clear about the limit: the audit catches quantities appearing or vanishing, amounts
//! left unclaimed on the bus, and fluxes disagreeing face by face across a shared boundary.
//! It does *not* catch a model that is internally consistent and physically wrong — publish
//! a power where a joule was wanted and both sides agree perfectly about a number off by
//! `1/dt`. For that, check against something the code did not compute: a closed form, an
//! exact limit, or a convergence rate.
//!
//! `cargo run --example agents_quickstart` is all of the above as a running program,
//! including a deliberate leak so the failure is visible. `AGENTS.md` in the repository is
//! the one-page version.
//!
//! # The dependency rule
//!
//! ```text
//! pantometry-units       no dependencies but glam and serde
//! pantometry-core        depends on units          the kernel: what evolves, what it conserves
//! pantometry-optics      depends on core   ┐
//! pantometry-thermal     depends on core   │
//! pantometry-mechanics   depends on core   ├ one crate per physics, and none knows another
//! pantometry-acoustic    depends on core   │
//! pantometry-molecular   depends on core   │
//! pantometry-electrical  depends on core   ┘
//! pantometry-scene       depends on core           where things are, and what a run looks like
//! pantometry-view        depends on scene          how to draw that, chosen by the data's shape
//! pantometry             depends on all of them
//! ```
//!
//! None of the ten domains knows about any of the others. They meet on the kernel's
//! [`Exchange`](pantometry_core::Exchange), and each one that arrived left the others
//! untouched — which is the claim the split was made to test, now held six times.
//!
//! [`scene`] and [`view`] are layers up rather than domains, and they are bound by the same rule
//! from the other side: neither names a domain. A physics that arrives tomorrow is captured
//! without `scene` being edited, and drawn without `view` being edited, because the scene asks
//! each domain what it *offers* and the view dispatches on the shape of what came back.
//! `ARCHITECTURE.md` is the long version.

// Every public item carries a doc comment. Denied rather than warned: a public physics API
// whose `Length::mm` shows a blank summary in rustdoc is documented in the sense that a
// paragraph exists somewhere, and not in the sense a reader needs.
