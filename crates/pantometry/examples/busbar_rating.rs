//! The other examples ask whether the physics is right. This one asks the question an engineer is
//! actually paid to answer, and it runs the whole way from geometry to a production yield:
//!
//! ```text
//!   1  geometry  → resistance      a bolted joint is a constriction, and no formula gives its R
//!   2  network   → thermal path    W/K out of the joint, from the solved balance
//!   3  fixed point                 R rises with T, T rises with I²R — solve them together
//!   4  bisection → the rating      the current that lands the joint on its limit
//!   5  runaway                     the current at which the feedback stops converging at all
//!   6  Monte Carlo → yield         with the tolerances a factory actually holds
//! ```
//!
//! # The one thing that makes this trustworthy
//!
//! Every step above has a closed form to check it against, and the last two share one:
//!
//! ```text
//!   ΔT(I) = I²R₂₀ / (g − I²R₂₀α)          the fixed point, solved exactly
//!   I_runaway = √( g / (R₂₀α) )           where that denominator reaches zero
//! ```
//!
//! So the iteration is checked against the algebra, the algebra's pole is checked against
//! `Winding::runaway_current`, and the resistance that feeds both is checked against `ρL/A` for a
//! plain bar and against the classical constriction resistance `ρ/2a` for the joint. A design
//! study whose numbers cannot be checked is a design study that reports whatever it computed.
//!
//! # Where a reduction is used, and why that is the professional choice
//!
//! The joint's resistance is solved as a **field**, because a constriction has no `ρL/A`. The
//! thermal path is a **four-node network**, because the sweep below evaluates it about 900 times
//! and a 3D conduction solve of a body whose Biot number is 0.003 would be spending an hour to
//! confirm what a lumped model gets right in microseconds.
//!
//! Solve the hard geometry once; sweep the reduction. Using the expensive model everywhere is not
//! rigour, it is a failure to know which question is being asked.
