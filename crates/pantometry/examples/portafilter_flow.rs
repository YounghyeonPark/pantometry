//! `espresso_shot` cuts the puck open and colours the inside. This one does the other thing: it
//! builds the hardware — shower screen, basket, body, spout — and lets you watch parcels of water
//! leave the screen, work down through the grounds, and come out the bottom darker than they went
//! in.
//!
//! # Where the water actually goes, and who decided
//!
//! Nothing here places a streamline by hand. `Puck` solves `∇·((k/μ)∇p) = 0` on the permeability
//! the grind and the packing give, and a parcel is advected by the **pore** velocity of that
//! solved field — `u/ε`, not `u`, which is a factor of 2.2 and the commonest error in porous
//! transport. Where a parcel goes is a consequence; the picture is a readout, not a drawing.
//!
//! The colour is what it is carrying. A parcel picks up dissolved coffee from every cell it
//! crosses, so it leaves the screen at zero and arrives at the spout loaded — which is why an
//! espresso *looks* like that, and it is the same field the yield is computed from.
//!
//! # What is solved and what is only drawn
//!
//! Stated plainly, because a picture does not distinguish them and a reader will assume the
//! flattering answer:
//!
//! | | |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | inside the basket | **solved.** Darcy, advection, dissolution |
//! | the headspace above the puck | drawn. A full plenum, so the mean speed is the superficial velocity — right, and not interesting |
//! | below the basket floor | drawn. A continuous jet — see below |
//! | the hardware | drawn. Geometry, no physics |
//!
//! The two baskets differ only in the ring against the wall — 0.60 against 0.45 — and everything
//! you can see between them follows from that one number.
//!
//! # The stream out of the spout is a stream, not parcels
//!
//! A parcel falls the 75 mm from the basket to the cup in about 0.12 s, and a frame is 0.7 s
//! apart, so sampling parcels there catches roughly none of them: the first version drew the
//! basket beautifully and had nothing at all between the spout and the cup.
//!
//! What is physically there is a **continuous jet**, so that is what is drawn — strands from the
//! spout to the cup, coloured by the concentration leaving the basket at that instant. It carries
//! the outlet's real number and none of its own; a parcel is a sample of something discrete, and
//! a stream is not discrete.
//!
//! # Read the two side by side as *equal time*, not equal weight
//!
//! Both run the same 25 s, so the channelled one is 42% heavier in the cup and its yield reads
//! *higher*. That is not the gap being an improvement — it is 42% more water having gone through.
//! `espresso_shot` makes the comparison a barista actually makes, which is to a weight, and there
//! the channelled shot loses. Here the comparison is to a clock, because two baskets on two
//! different clocks cannot share a frame.
