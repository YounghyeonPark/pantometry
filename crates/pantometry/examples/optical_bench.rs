//! A three-dimensional optical bench: elements placed by pose, rays traced through them, and a
//! layout you can rotate in a browser.
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo run --release --example optical_bench             # numbers, checked
//! cargo run --release --example optical_bench bench.html  # and the 3D layout
//! ```
//!
//! Every other example here draws a graph. This one draws the **instrument**: a collimated beam,
//! a doublet, a fold mirror that turns the axis through 90°, and the rays arriving at a tilted
//! image plane — as paths in space, on one page, rotatable and scrollable with nothing installed.
//!
//! # What this is and is not
//!
//! It is the analysis half of an optical layout tool: place, trace, measure, look. Ray paths are a
//! first-class shape in the scene layer now — `PanelData::Paths` — so the view draws them the same
//! way it draws bodies and fields, depth-sorted and on one colour scale.
//!
//! It is **not** an interactive editor and there is no renderer with materials or shadows. Nothing
//! here is real-time; a run produces a file. Those are different products and this workspace does
//! not pretend otherwise.
//!
//! # What is checked, because a picture is not a result
//!
//! A layout that looks right is the easiest wrong answer in optics. So:
//!
//! - the doublet's focal length, against the thin-lens combination of its two powers;
//! - the fold, against the law of reflection — the axis leaves at exactly 90° to how it arrived;
//! - the marginal ray's height at the stop, against `h = f·tanθ` for each field angle;
//! - the RMS spot against the diffraction limit, so "in focus" is a number and not a look.
//!
//! Each is arithmetic done here, not a value read back out of the thing being checked.
