//! A small domain's leak, hidden inside a large domain's total.
//!
//! The whole-simulation audit sums every ledger before comparing, so the scale it measures against
//! is the *sum*. A domain holding a microjoule beside one holding a kilojoule can lose everything
//! it has without moving that sum by anything a tolerance could catch — and no tolerance fixes it,
//! because the problem is the scale rather than the number.
//!
//! `Domain::books_balance` is the opt-in that says "check me on my own", and this file is the
//! demonstration that it makes a difference.
