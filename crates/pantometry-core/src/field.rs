//! Quantities that vary over space and time.
//!
//! Continuum physics is fields most of the way down: a temperature field, a
//! velocity field, a stress field, an electromagnetic field. They differ in what
//! they hold and in the equation that governs them, but the three operators used
//! to write those equations — gradient, divergence, Laplacian — are the same
//! three every time. Implementing them once is most of what a kernel owes a
//! continuum domain.
//!
//! # Values are raw SI numbers, and that is a real limitation
//!
//! A [`ScalarField`] returns `f64` and a [`VectorField`] returns `DVec3`, both in
//! SI base units, rather than the dimensioned types from `pantometry-units`. The
//! dimension varies per field — kelvin here, pascals there — and expressing "the
//! gradient of this field has the field's dimension divided by a length" needs
//! arithmetic on const generic parameters, which is unstable. So the dimension
//! lives on the concrete type that implements the trait, and is documented rather
//! than checked, at exactly this one boundary.
//!
//! # The derivatives are finite differences, and the step matters
//!
//! Central differences, second-order accurate, with the step passed in. There is
//! no good default for it: too large and the truncation error dominates, too small
//! and cancellation in the subtraction does. For a field with curvature scale `Lc`
//! and values near 1, `h ≈ Lc * 1e-5` is a reasonable start, and a field that
//! knows its own analytic derivative should override these methods and skip the
//! question entirely.

/// # Why the kernel knows this
///
/// It is a property of a *field*, not of a physics — the kernel learns nothing about any domain
/// from it, which is the rule this has to clear. What it prevents is a lossy round trip: a
/// solver's values are exact where the solver put them, and asking anywhere else runs them
/// through an interpolant for no reason. A caller sampling a field on the field's own grid should
/// get the field's own numbers back.
///
/// **Measured, before this existed.** A six-cell block holding `0 0 100 0 0 0 °C` was written to
/// the run file as `0 0 90 0 0 0` — the peak 10% low — because the sampler placed its six points
/// at `i/(n−1)` of the extent, which is the cell *boundaries*, and every consumer in the
/// workspace reads that array: the viewer, the report, glTF, USD and the CSV.
///
/// # Both conventions are here and neither is a mistake
///
/// `Room` and `Hall` take `dx = width/(nx−1)`, so their outermost samples are *on* the wall,
/// which is where a pressure antinode is; `Well` stores the exact zeros at its walls. Those are
/// [`Nodal`](Lattice::Nodal) and sampling them corner to corner is right. `Bar1D`, `Solid3D`,
/// `Conductor`, `Cavity`, `Channel` and `Puck` hold cell averages and have nothing on the
/// boundary. Those are [`Centred`](Lattice::Centred). A single convention would have been wrong
/// for one half or the other, which is why this is a question the field answers rather than a
