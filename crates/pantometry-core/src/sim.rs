//! Running several domains at once.
//!
//! A domain is a piece of physics that can be stepped: heat in a block of glass,
//! a rigid body under contact, light through a train of surfaces. Each one knows
//! its own equations and nothing about the others. This module is how they share
//! a clock and a budget without knowing about each other.
//!
//! # The timescale problem, which is the real one
//!
//! Domains do not agree on how big a step is. An explicit FDTD electromagnetic
//! solver on a nanometre grid is stable to about 10⁻¹⁷ s; heat conduction to about
//! 10⁻⁹ s; rigid contact to 10⁻⁴ s; and a thermal drift that defocuses an
//! instrument plays out over seconds. Stepping all of them at the smallest limit
//! integrates the slow ones ten billion times for nothing.
//!
//! Two mechanisms deal with that, and they are the reason this module is not just
//! a `for` loop over domains:
//!
//! - **[`Kind::QuasiStatic`]** — a domain with no state to roll forward, which is
//!   re-solved on demand instead of stepped. Light crosses an instrument in
//!   nanoseconds; against a thermal timescale that is zero, so optics is not
//!   integrated at all. This is the largest single saving available, and it is
//!   what the closed-form [`Motion`](crate::motion::Motion) and the instantaneous
//!   `SurfaceOptics` were already doing before there was a scheduler to notice.
//! - **[`Schedule::Multirate`]** — each evolving domain takes as many equal
//!   substeps of the shared window as its own stability limit requires, so the
//!   slow domain is not dragged down to the fast one's step.
//!
//! # Coupling, and why it goes through a bus
//!
//! Domains never touch each other. They publish to and consume from an
//! [`Exchange`], which is a set of named channels carrying SI amounts. That is not
//! only a borrow-checker convenience: it is what makes the transfer *auditable*.
//! Each domain conserves energy internally, but the interface between two
//! discretisations of the same surface — ray hits on one side, mesh nodes on the
//! other — is exactly where interpolation quietly loses or invents some. The bus
//! compares what was published against what was consumed and refuses to let the
//! difference pass silently.
//!
//! # What the schedules cost
//!
//! [`Schedule::OneWay`] is unconditionally stable and embarrassingly parallel,
//! because nothing feeds back. [`Schedule::Staggered`] costs one exchange per
//! step and is stable only while the coupling is weak — and *not* fixable by
//! shrinking `dt`, since some strongly coupled systems (the standard example is
//! fluid-structure interaction at comparable densities, the added-mass effect)
//! become more unstable as the step shrinks. That is what
//! [`Schedule::Iterative`] is for, and why it is worth its cost.
