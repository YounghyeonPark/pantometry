//! What a piece of matter is, across every domain that cares.
//!
//! N-BK7 is not only a refractive index. It is 2.51 g/cm³, it conducts 1.11 W/m·K,
//! it holds 858 J/kg·K, it expands 7.1 ppm per kelvin and it fails at about
//! 60 MPa. A thermal solver needs the middle three, a mechanical one the last two,
//! and an optical one the index — but it is *one piece of glass*, and if each
//! domain carries its own idea of what it is made of then nothing can be coupled,
//! because there is no single object for a coupling to be about.
//!
//! So the properties live together and each domain reads the part it needs.
//! Everything is [`Option`]: a thermal-only simulation is not made to invent a
//! Young's modulus, and a property that is absent says so rather than defaulting
//! to a plausible lie.
//!
//! # Optics is deliberately missing
//!
//! There is no optical field here. This crate is the kernel and must not know that
//! optics exists — refractive index is `pantometry-optics`'s
//! `Material`, and a consumer that needs both pairs them. Putting it here would
//! make the kernel depend on a domain, which is the one structural rule the split
//! exists to enforce.
