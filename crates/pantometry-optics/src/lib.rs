//! pantometry-optics: light, as a domain built on the `pantometry-core` kernel.
//!
//! Spectral radiometry, surface optics, dispersion and ray geometry. This is the
//! first domain, and its job is partly to prove the kernel can hold one: it uses
//! the kernel's [`Violation`](pantometry_core::Violation) for a surface that would
//! create light, the kernel's [`Rng`](pantometry_core::Rng) for every stochastic
//! choice, and the kernel's units throughout — and the kernel knows nothing about
//! any of it.
//!
//! Units are SI in storage and dimensioned in the API. Wavelengths are
//! [`Length`](pantometry_units::Length), so a path length cannot be passed as one; the
//! `_nm` fields inside [`Spectrum`] are the serialised form, where a readable
//! `"center_nm": 488` beats a correct `4.88e-7`.
//!
//! # The two invariants, in this domain
//!
//! **Energy is conserved at every surface.** [`SurfaceOptics`] stores reflectance
//! and transmittance; absorptance is the remainder. [`SurfaceOptics::validate`]
//! rejects a surface that would gain energy, and [`SurfaceOptics::split`]
//! renormalises rather than amplifying if one is traced anyway.
//!
//! **Nothing is random.** Every sampled scatter comes from a seeded generator, and
//! [`Rng::for_index`](pantometry_core::Rng::for_index) makes that hold under
//! parallelism as well as in sequence.
//!
//! # What is in it
//!
//! | Module | |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | [`spectrum`] | Wavelength-dependent quantities: Planck's law, Gaussians, measured curves, filter bands with real edges and finite blocking |
//! | [`optics`] | What a surface does to light — Fresnel from the refractive indices, spectral R/T/A, coatings, polarisation split, scatter sampling |
//! | [`material`] | Refractive index against wavelength (Sellmeier and Cauchy, with a small glass catalogue), Abbe number, and how much light survives the glass |
//! | [`geometry`] | Rays and hits, intersections against caps, conics, planes, annuli and cylinders, Snell's law, and disc sampling |
//! | [`diffraction`] | What a *perfect* system does: Airy patterns, encircled energy, the ideal MTF, Rayleigh and Abbe limits |
//! | [`wavefront`] | What an imperfect one does: Zernike aberrations, pupil transforms, aberrated PSFs and their MTFs |
//! | [`propagation`] | Walking a field between planes by the angular spectrum, checked against a Gaussian beam |
//! | [`coherence`] | The coherent and incoherent limits, and how coherent a source is at a distance |
//! | [`radiometry`] | Integrating a spectrum, and the difference between watts and photons |
//! | [`detector`] | Turning photons into a number, and the four noises that come with it |
//!
//! # What is deliberately not in it
//!
//! No scene graph, no meshes, no acceleration structure, no renderer.
//!
//! Fields propagate between planes only through free space: there is nothing to put in
//! the beam's way except an aperture, and no element that refracts or reflects it
//! mid-flight.
//!
//! And partial coherence is a transfer function rather than a simulation.
//! [`coherence`] gives the two exact limits and the coherence a source has at a
//! distance; computing an arbitrary object's partially coherent image needs the
//! transmission cross-coefficients, which are a four-dimensional integral and are not
//! here.

// Every public item carries a doc comment. Denied rather than warned: a public physics API
// whose `Length::mm` shows a blank summary in rustdoc is documented in the sense that a
// paragraph exists somewhere, and not in the sense a reader needs.
