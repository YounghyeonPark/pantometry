//! Current as a field, so `I²R` is a consequence of a shape rather than a number somebody typed.
//!
//! [`Winding`](crate::Winding) states its resistance from `ρL/A` and dissipates `I²R`. That is
//! exactly right for a wire, which *is* a uniform bar, and it is the model a motor designer
//! actually uses. It is also the whole of what a lumped electrical model can say: given `R`, it
//! returns `I²R`, and the interesting question — where the heat is, and why `R` is what it is —
//! is assumed rather than answered.
//!
//! A [`Conductor`] is the other half. It is a block of material with a conductivity per cell and
//! two electrodes, and it **solves** for the potential:
//!
//! ```text
//!   ∇·(σ ∇φ) = 0        inside
//!   φ = 0, φ = V        on the two electrodes
//!   J·n = 0             everywhere else
//! ```
//!
//! From that, `J = −σ∇φ` and the dissipation is `∫ σ|∇φ|² dV`. Nobody states a resistance; it
//! comes out, and for a uniform bar it comes out as `ρL/A` **exactly** — which is what makes this
//! checkable rather than merely plausible.
//!
//! # What the field formulation buys
//!
//! Three things a lumped resistor cannot say:
//!
//! - **A shape that is not a bar has no `ρL/A`.** A constriction, a via, a busbar with a corner,
//!   a contact patch — each has a resistance that is a property of its geometry, and the closed
//!   forms that exist for them (spreading resistance is `ρ/4a` for a circular contact into a
//!   half-space) are limits rather than formulas you can apply to a shape.
//! - **Where the heat is.** `I²R` gives a total. A current crowding into a corner dissipates in
//!   that corner, and a joint fails at the hot spot rather than at the average. This domain hands
//!   the density over as a field, so a thermal domain on the other side of the bus can take it
//!   *where it landed* rather than as a lump.
//! - **Series and parallel are consequences, not cases.** Two materials in series add their
//!   resistances and two side by side add their conductances, and neither is coded — both fall
//!   out of the same solve. That is what the tests check, because a formulation that got one of
//!   them wrong would still look like electricity.
//!
//! # Quasi-static, and why the solve is not a march
//!
//! This is [`Kind::QuasiStatic`]. Charge relaxes in a metal in about `ε/σ` — 1.5×10⁻¹⁹ s for
//! copper — so on any timescale a simulation cares about the current distribution is the
//! *solution* of an elliptic problem and not the state of a marched one. Nothing here has a
//! stability limit, and the step is a solve rather than an advance.
//!
//! # The solve, and what it refuses to do quietly
//!
//! Conjugate gradients on the symmetric positive-definite system the finite-volume
//! discretisation gives. Deterministic: a fixed iteration order, a fixed starting vector, no
//! threads, no clock. [`Conductor::residual`] reports what it achieved and
//! [`Conductor::converged`] whether it met the tolerance — and a step that did **not** converge
//! returns a [`Violation`] rather than a plausible-looking potential field.
//!
//! That last one is deliberate and is the failure this workspace keeps finding. An iterative
//! solver that stops at its iteration cap returns something shaped exactly like an answer: smooth,
//! bounded, roughly right in the middle and wrong at the edges. Nothing downstream can tell.
