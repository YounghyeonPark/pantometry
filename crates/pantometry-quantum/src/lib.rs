//! pantometry-quantum: the Schrödinger equation, as a domain on the `pantometry-core` kernel.
//!
//! One particle in one dimension, inside a well whose walls are infinitely hard:
//!
//! ```text
//! iℏ ∂ψ/∂t = −(ℏ²/2m) ∂²ψ/∂x² + V(x)ψ,      ψ = 0 at both walls
//! ```
//!
//! marched with Visscher's staggered real/imaginary scheme (P. B. Visscher, *A fast explicit
//! algorithm for the time-dependent Schrödinger equation*, Computers in Physics **5**, 596,
//! 1991): the real part of ψ lives at whole steps and the imaginary part half a step later,
//! each updated explicitly from the other through the discrete Hamiltonian. It is the same
//! staggered-leapfrog family as the acoustic domains, and it earns its place here the same
//! way the Yee grid earns its place in the electromagnetic one — by conserving the quantity
//! that matters **as an identity of the update** rather than as an accuracy claim. The
//! discrete probability
//!
//! ```text
//! P = Σⱼ [ Rⱼ(t)² + Iⱼ(t+dt/2)·Iⱼ(t−dt/2) ] · dx
//! ```
//!
//! telescopes to a boundary term under one step, and the boundary is a wall where ψ is zero,
//! so the update cannot change it at all — for a fixed step. `P` pairs `I` across two
//! consecutive steps, so changing `dt` re-pairs the levels and moves it once, by `O(dt²)`,
//! the same way starting the leapfrog does; the tests measure both. That is what this
//! domain's [`Ledger`] carries, under the name [`PROBABILITY`], normalised to 1.
//!
//! # What it is checked against
//!
//! Closed forms, never a second implementation:
//!
//! - **The discrete eigenvalues, exactly.** On interior nodes with ψ = 0 walls, the
//!   three-point Hamiltonian's eigenvectors *are* the sampled `sin(nπx/L)`, with eigenvalue
//!   `E = (2ℏ²/m·dx²)·sin²(nπ·dx/2L)` — so a sampled eigenstate's density is stationary
//!   under the march and its phase rotates at a rate the closed form predicts to rounding.
//! - **Second-order convergence** of those eigenvalues to `n²π²ℏ²/2mL²`, measured across
//!   grid doublings rather than asserted at one resolution.
//! - **Free wavepacket spreading**, `σ(t)² = σ₀²(1 + (ℏt/2mσ₀²)²)`.
//! - **Ehrenfest's theorem on a harmonic potential**: for quadratic `V`, `⟨x⟩` follows the
//!   classical cosine exactly in the continuum, and the discretisation error must fall at
//!   second order.
//!
//! # What is deliberately not in it
//!
//! One particle, which is the honest boundary of a grid method: a second particle squares
//! the state space rather than doubling the array, and pretending otherwise is how a
//! "quantum" module ends up simulating classical waves. No spin, no second or third
//! dimension, no open or absorbing boundaries (the walls are infinite and reflect — a
//! complex absorbing potential would make the probability books *supposed* to fall, which is
//! a different domain), no time-dependent potentials, and no measurement. Momentum is not on
//! the ledger, and neither is ⟨H⟩: the ledger carries exactly the one quantity the scheme
//! conserves identically, and the energy expectation is a [`Domain::readings`] entry checked
//! for drift in tests instead.
//!
//! # The eleventh domain, and what it had to add to the kernel
//!
//! Nothing. Optics, heat, mechanics, sound, molecules, electricity, percolation, elasticity,
//! electromagnetism and fluid flow each arrived without the kernel changing, and this crate
//! extends that claim rather than testing it for the first time: `probability` is a ledger
//! name the kernel has never heard of, carried by the same [`Ledger`] that carries joules.
//!
//! # Units and scales
//!
//! SI throughout, like everywhere else in the workspace: metres, kilograms, seconds, joules.
//! An electron in a nanometre well sits comfortably inside `f64` — energies around 10⁻¹⁹ J,
//! stable steps of a few attoseconds, periods of femtoseconds — so there is no internal unit
//! system to convert in and out of.

// Every public item carries a doc comment. Denied rather than warned: a public physics API
// whose constructor shows a blank summary in rustdoc is documented in the sense that a
// paragraph exists somewhere, and not in the sense a reader needs.

    /// keep `dt ≤ 2ℏ/|E|` for **every** eigenvalue. The three-point kinetic spectrum on
    /// interior nodes is `(2ℏ²/m·dx²)·sin²(kπ·dx/2L)`, strictly inside `(0, 2ℏ²/m·dx²)`,
    /// and the potential this crate builds is non-negative, shifting eigenvalues up by at
    /// most `V_max` — so `2ℏ²/m·dx² + V_max` bounds the spectrum and the limit follows.
    /// The bound is sharp to `O((π·dx/2L)²)`: the top eigenvalue sits at
    /// `cos²(π·dx/2L)` of the kinetic supremum, so almost nothing is given away.

    /// For the bare well this is `m·dx²/ℏ` — a **diffusion-shaped** limit, not a CFL one.
