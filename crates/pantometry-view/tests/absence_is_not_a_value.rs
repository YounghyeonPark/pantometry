//! What each writer does with a sample that is not a number.
//!
//! A field gained cells with nothing in them, and every writer here had an answer for them that
//! looked like an answer for something. Measured on a real scene before the fix: the glTF carried
//! 252 points for a grid with 120 solid cells, so two thirds of what went to Blender was material
//! that is not there; the SVG drew the empty ones in the **middle** colour of the ramp, because
//! `NaN as i32` saturates to zero and zero is the middle bucket, so an empty cell was the same
//! colour as a cell at the average; and the JSON writers would have emitted the literal `NaN`,
//! which is not a JSON token at all.
//!
//! One rule, four writers: **absence is not a value.** These are on the writers. The sampler that
//! decides what is absent has its own, in `pantometry-thermal`.
