# Scenes

Twenty-eight worlds described as data, covering **all eleven** of the library's domains — twenty-six of them
one physics at a time, and one that is actually a world. Nothing here is Rust: the
physics, the resolution, the coupling and the run length are all in the file, and the same
binary runs all of them.

```sh
cargo run --release -p pantometry-world -- scenes/03-room-pulse.json
cargo run --release -p pantometry-world -- scenes/03-room-pulse.json out.svg
cargo run --release -p pantometry-world -- --check scenes/03-room-pulse.json
```

`--check` parses and builds without running: the format version, the domain names, a `tracks`
pointing at a node the scene defines. It reports a parse failure as `file:line:column` with the
keys that were expected, which is what an editor puts a squiggle under. CI runs it over every
scene, because it would otherwise be the one entry point nothing exercises.

Every file carries a `format` number, and **absence means 1** — which is what all twenty-eight here
are: nothing has yet changed what an existing key means. A version this build cannot read is refused
rather than half-run: `deny_unknown_fields` catches a key that was *added*, but not one whose
meaning changed, and that is what the number is for.

No second argument prints the numbers and checks them. A second argument writes an asset, and
**the extension chooses which** — because a run has several shapes and only one is a picture:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `out.html` | A report that **picks a view per domain from its shape**, and opens in a browser. A 3D field gets two: a rotatable render and every slice |
| `out.svg` | A filmstrip: every frame on one page, one colour scale throughout so frames compare |
| `out.csv` | Every domain's scalars over time, one row per frame, units in the header |
| `out.json` | The frames themselves — fields as grids, bodies as positions in space, readings beside them |
| `out.gltf` | The last frame as **surfaces** — a field's boundary, a body's sphere, with normals — for Blender, three.js or any glTF reader |
| `out.usda` | The **whole run** as USD: geometry, colour and every domain's scalars, animated on a timeline, for usdview, Omniverse, Houdini or Maya |

`.csv` is the one that reaches the domains a picture cannot. Twelve of these twenty-eight scenes have
a domain with no field and no bodies, and for several the scalar *is* the result: `13` is about a
winding whose resistance follows its own temperature, and it drew nothing at all. As a table it
shows the feedback directly — 12.46 W at 25 °C rising to 16.01 W at 99 °C, with the resistance
going 3.11 to 4.00 Ω beside it.

`.html` is for someone who can state a simulation and does not want to decide how to draw it.
The shape of the data makes the choice, not the domain's name: scalars over time become a line
chart, a 1D field a profile over a ghost of the whole run, a 2D field an animated heatmap, and
bodies a rotatable depth-sorted scene. A new domain gets a sensible picture without the reporter
learning about it — which is the same reason `Domain::as_field` exists.

One scale per panel, fixed across every frame, in all four views. A frame that rescales makes a
quantity *look* constant while it changes by orders of magnitude, and that is the one thing a
picture of a simulation must never do.

And the picture has numbers on it. Every spatial axis is in metres — a room is 4.4 m by 3.1 m and
not "61 x 43" — because a field carries the box it was sampled over; hovering reads back the
sample under the cursor, its index, its position and its value; the scalar chart groups series by
unit so two temperatures forty kelvin apart no longer draw the same line; and the colour scale is
built in CIE LCh so a larger value is never darker than a smaller one. The scale that shipped
before this ran backwards for 89 of its 255 steps.

**All four writers are `pantometry-view`, and none of them is this application's.** This crate is
`publish = false`, so while they lived here they were unreachable — a consumer who could state a
simulation could not draw it. `pantometry_view::{html, svg, readings_csv, to_json}` takes the frames
`pantometry_scene::capture` produces, and everything the table above describes is available to any
program without going near a scene file.

`.gltf` is the one that leaves this workspace. Eighteen of the twenty-eight scenes have geometry to
export — bodies, ray paths, a 3D field as its cell centres — and the other ten are **refused with
a reason** rather than written as an empty scene: a 1D or 2D field is a graph, not something to put
in a 3D viewer, and the message says which panel and why.

The recommendation on record is to export into the rendering tools rather than rebuild them. This
is that, and it cost no dependency: glTF is JSON with the binary base64'd inside it, which is the
same reason SVG was chosen over a raster format.

Nothing generated is committed.

`cargo run -p pantometry-world -- --emit-default scene.json` writes a starting point.

## Sound — `pantometry-acoustic`

| Scene | What it shows |
| --- | --- |
| `01-room-mode` | The (1,1) mode of a 4.4 × 3.1 m room: the whole field breathing in and out together, one nodal line each way |
| `02-room-higher-mode` | The (3,2) mode of the same room — more nodal lines, a higher note, and a shorter run to catch it |
| `03-room-pulse` | A clap near a corner. No standing shape, so it travels, reflects off all four walls and interferes with itself |
| `16-a-room-with-a-ceiling` | The same room with a **ceiling**, released in its oblique (1,1,1) mode. 97.46 Hz, and the peak rides `\|cos(2πft)\|` to within 0.3% at 23 nodes across |

`16` is the scene `01`–`03` cannot be. A floor plan does not have the floor-to-ceiling mode
inaccurately; it does not have it. At 2.4 m that mode is 71 Hz, and the number of modes below a
given frequency grows as `f³` rather than `f²` — which is why a real room's resonances merge into
a hiss where a two-dimensional model keeps them separable much further up.

It costs what the third dimension costs: 23 × 17 × 13 nodes rather than 23 × 17, and `√3` in the
Courant limit rather than `√2`. That is the trade, stated rather than hidden, and `Room` remains
the right model for a floor plan.

## Heat — `pantometry-thermal`, and the two ways domains meet

| Scene | What it shows |
| --- | --- |
| `04-heater-and-bar` | A plain channel. The heater's joules have no *place*, so they land in the bar's first cell and conduct along it |
| `05-beam-on-bar` | A shared boundary. The beam's joules do have a place, so a spot forms where it points and then spreads |

Those two are the same physics told twice, and the difference between them is the whole
argument for `Interface` and `Flux`. A conservation audit passes either way; only the picture
tells them apart.

| Scene | What it shows |
| --- | --- |
| `15-a-hot-spot-in-a-block` | One cell of a 9×9×9 aluminium block starting 60 K hot, and the spot spreading in **three** dimensions. The scene that a one-dimensional bar cannot express: heat going sideways is the whole job of a spreader plate |
| `19-a-coating-stops-the-heat` | The same spot in a 9×9×18 block that is aluminium for half its depth and **borosilicate** for the other half. 150× the conductivity leaves the metal nearly isothermal and the glass barely touched, so the entire temperature drop sits on one face — and the test asserts the largest cell-to-cell step along z is exactly the interface one, which is what a block with the coating quietly not applied would fail |
| `20-melting-a-block-of-ice` | A hundred watts into 1331 mm³ of ice at −10 °C. The mean holds at **exactly 0.000 °C** for 3.6 of the 5 s while `melted` climbs a straight line at 326.9 mm³/s — which is `P/ρL` and has no rate constant in it — and then the leftover 67.9 J warms what is now all water by 27.126 K, against 27.126 predicted. The scene a domain with no latent heat cannot express: without it the block would sail through zero and finish near 190 °C |

| `21-a-wax-thermal-buffer` | Twenty watts into 10 648 mm³ of **n-octadecane**, which is not in the catalogue and is written out in the scene's own `materials` block. It holds 28.150 °C from 11 s to the end while `melted` climbs 100.6968 mm³/s against a `P/ρL` of 100.6968, agreeing to **8.3e-15** — the same closed form `20` measures, now with the density and latent heat coming out of the *file*. The 1200 J of reserve runs out at 60 s and the melting stops dead at 5354 mm³, 50.3% of the block. The energy accounts to `1.1e-14`: 136.6176 J to warm 8.667 g of wax by 8.15 K and 1063.3824 J to melt half of it, which is all 1200 J and not most of it |

`20` is the one that needs latent heat, and its plateau is the whole of what latent heat *is*: a
temperature that stops moving while energy keeps arriving. Ice is the only entry in the catalogue that
melts, and a block that cannot melt does not report a `melted` column at all — so the column's
presence is itself the check that `"material": "ice"` reached the domain.

| `22-wax-in-an-aluminium-matrix` | The same wax as `21`, now four fifths of a **composite** whose other fifth is aluminium — the scene's `composites` block mixes a declared substance with a catalogue one. It holds the same 28.150 °C, and `melted` climbs **125.8710 mm³/s against 100.6968** for the pure wax: exactly `1/0.8`, a ratio with no material property left in it. 1200.0000 J = 151.2823 warming + 1048.7177 melting, to `1.7e-14` |
| `23-a-part-radiating-to-its-lid` | A hot part sealed in a housing, surrounded on five sides by **nothing** and facing a cooled lid across a two-cell clearance. The part has no conducting face to anywhere, so the only path its heat has is the parallel-plate exchange across the gap — which makes the whole thing a two-body lumped system with a closed form. It sheds **36.93 K in 600 s against 37.01 K** from an RK4 integration of `σA(T₁⁴−T₂⁴)/(1/ε₁+1/ε₂−1)` and `hA(T−T∞)`, agreeing to **0.20%**. The scene the format could not state until `regions` learned `initial_c` and `"void"`, and the answer is a **surface-finish** answer: the same geometry in polished copper, ε = 0.04, sheds 1.2 K |
| `24-a-power-module-junction-to-ambient` | A silicon die dissipating **45 W** through the stack under it — solder, alumina DBC, copper, a 3000 W/m^2K cold plate. The scene the format could not state at all before `dissipation`: every other source here hands watts to the *bus*, which carries an amount and no location, so a die's heat would have spread over the baseplate as fast as over the die and there would be no junction temperature to read. At steady state it is a resistance stack, and the test writes every term of it out from the geometry: **181.19 C measured against 181.21 C** for a 3.1379 K/W path, agreeing to `1.1e-4` of the 141 K rise. The ceramic is 0.46 K/W of that and the film 2.31 |
| `25-what-140-kelvin-does-to-the-solder` | The same module as `24`, with a **structure** on the same grid whose stress-free strain is the block's temperature — the first scene that couples two physics on one mesh, and the first to reach `pantometry-elastic` at all. The failure mode of a real module is not its temperature: it is the solder, fatigued by silicon at 2.6e-6 per kelvin sitting on solder at 2.15e-5. Assembled at its reflow temperature of 217 C, so it is **already strained before it is switched on** — cold, the solder wants `2.15e-5 x (40 - 217)` = `-3.8055e-3` exactly — and it *relaxes* as it heats back towards where it was built: 0.2314 J of strain energy falling to 0.0274 J, **8.4x**, monotonically |
| `26-poiseuille-in-a-cooling-channel` | Water driven down a 2 mm channel by a body force, the first scene to reach `pantometry-fluid` — the domain this workspace's own docs call the hardest to trust, because *it looks like a fluid* is the easiest wrong answer in computational physics to accept. So it is written around an exact solution, and against the **discrete** parabola rather than the continuum one: a no-slip wall imposed by reflecting the first cell makes the linear interpolation vanish there, and a parabola is not its own linear interpolation, so the settled mean is `(gh²/12v)(1 + 2/n²)` exactly. Measured `6.691655e-3` against `6.691982e-3` m/s. The tolerance is the **startup transient**, predicted rather than chosen: 4 s is 9.9 time constants of `h²/(pi² v)`, leaving `5.0e-5` of the answer, and the run is off by `4.9e-5` |
| `27-a-cavity-ringing-at-its-own-frequency` | A 120 x 120 mm vacuum box seeded in its `(1,0,1)` mode, the first scene to reach `pantometry-em`. A resonance is a property of the box, so `f = (c/2)sqrt((l/a)^2 + (n/d)^2)` is what it is checked against: **1.766304 GHz measured against 1.766544**, off `1.4e-4` — and the bound is **Yee's own dispersion**, `(k dx)^2/24` = 1.4e-3, with the measurement required to come out *under* the continuum because a wave on this grid travels slow. The energy the audit watches is **not** `1/2 eE^2 + 1/2 uH^2`: E and H are half a step apart, so the naive sum swings 7.4% about the quantity leapfrog actually conserves, which holds to the bit across 200 frames. `div B` stays at 1.9e-13 — an identity of the discrete curl, not a convergence |
| `28-an-eigenstate-that-does-not-move` | An electron in the third state of a 10 nm hard-walled well — the last of the eleven domains to reach a scene, and the strongest claim a solver can be given: **an eigenstate is stationary.** Energy, position expectation and norm are asserted frame by frame and none of them moves at all. Checked against the **discrete** Hamiltonian's exact eigenvalue `(2hbar^2/m dx^2) sin^2(n pi/2(N+1))`, and the gap to the continuum `n^2 pi^2 hbar^2/2mL^2` is `theta^2/3` exactly — 1.8320e-4 measured against 1.8322e-4 predicted, which is the grid being measured as the grid instead of as the physics |

`22` is the pair to read with `21`, and the ratio between them is the whole point. Diluting the wax to four
fifths by volume makes a cubic millimetre of buffer hold a fifth less latent heat, so the same twenty watts
clear it a quarter faster — and `1.25` is `1/0.8` with the density and the latent heat cancelled out. The
*engineering* reason for the aluminium is the other number: 5 W/m·K against the wax's 0.358, fourteen times
better at getting heat in and out of the thing that stores it, which is what a metal-matrix phase-change
buffer is for.

That 5 is **the caller's choice and the format checks it**. No single conductivity exists for a composite
without knowing its microstructure, so the scene has to say which, and a value outside the Voigt and Reuss
bounds — 0.4473 to 33.6864 for this pair — is refused with both bounds and the tighter Hashin–Shtrikman
pair in the message, because a file has nowhere else to learn them. 5 sits inside HS's 0.6244 to 24.185,
which is where an aluminium foam at a fifth by volume belongs.

The latent heat dilutes by **mass** and not by volume, and that is the trap the scene exists to make
visible: four fifths of the volume is 54.67% of the mass, so the composite stores 133.4 kJ/kg and not
195.2. Using the volume fraction there would put the plateau 46% wrong.

`21` is the one that needs **no catalogue entry at all**, and it is the format's first `materials` key.
A wax is what a phase-change buffer is actually made of, no library will ever ship every material
somebody has a datasheet for, and enumeration was never going to close that gap — so a scene can write
a `Substance` out in full and use it exactly as it uses `"ice"`. Nothing downstream can tell which one
it got.

Three mistakes in a declaration are refused rather than accepted: an impossible substance, a name that
shadows a catalogue material, and — the one that is not obvious — a declaration **nothing goes on to
use**. `material` on a block is optional and defaults to aluminium, so declaring a wax and forgetting to
name it gives a block of metal that runs, audits and renders while answering about the wrong substance.
That is the same failure `19`'s empty region has, one level up, and it gets the same treatment.

This scene also carries the first `liquid` block: the melt conducts 0.152 W/m/K against the solid's
0.358, so the buffer insulates itself as it melts, which is the physically interesting thing about a wax
and something a single conductivity cannot say.

`19` is the one that needs `Solid3D::fill`, and it is the format's first `regions` key. A region is
**half-open** — `to` is one past the last cell — and one that selects no cells is refused rather than
ignored, because a mistyped bound is otherwise invisible: a block of one material runs, audits and
renders, and nothing anywhere says the coating was not applied.

`15` is the first scene whose field is a volume, and the report draws it as **every z-slice at
once** rather than as one plane with the rest behind a slider — because a viewer who never
touches a slider would see a picture of a solid that was really a picture of one plane through
it. The filmstrip has no room for that, so it draws the middle slice and *says* `z-slice 5/9` in
the label.

Its claim in `tests/scene.rs` is the one only three dimensions can make: the neighbour one cell
away along **z** is exactly as warm as the one along x. A model that resolved a plane and stacked
it, or that used the wrong spacing on one axis, fails there and passes everything else.

| Scene | What it shows |
| --- | --- |
| `11-motor-thermal-network` | 12 W into a copper winding, out through electrical steel and an aluminium housing. Three materials, two joints, and the drop across each |

The first of three scenes with **nothing to draw** -- `11`, `12` and `13`, which is the list
`tests/scene.rs` holds as `NOTHING_TO_DRAW`. A network's nodes have capacities, not positions, so
`as_field` declines to invent a continuum and the renderer has no panel to make — the numbers
are the output. That is also the point: a `lump` would report the motor as one temperature, and
the winding runs 13 K above the housing at half a time constant in. The thing that fails is not
the thing you can measure.

The scene test carries a matching list, so an undrawable scene has to earn its place with an
explicit check rather than passing by having nothing to check.

## Electricity — `pantometry-electrical`

| Scene | What it shows |
| --- | --- |
| `17-a-busbar-with-a-notch` | A 12 × 5 × 5 mm copper busbar with a notch three cells deep, driven at 1 mV. The resistance is **solved** rather than stated: 12.39 µΩ, against 8.28 µΩ for the full section |
| `18-an-espresso-shot` | Two 30 mm baskets, identical but for the ring against the wall. Nothing states a flow rate — Darcy's law is solved on the permeability that 250 µm at `ε = 0.45` gives. The gap makes that ring 2.9× more permeable, so it runs **79% faster** and delivers **4.54% TDS against 6.48%**: more liquid, less coffee in it |

The scene that shows why a field formulation is worth the solve. `ρL/A` is a statement about a
uniform bar, and a bar with a notch is not one — so the file states a *shape* and a material, and
the resistance comes out. The test asserts two bounds rather than the measured value: above
`ρL/A` for the full section, because removing conductor cannot help, and above a naive series
estimate that treats the notched slice as a shorter bar, because the current also has to spread
back out. The excess over the second **is** the spreading resistance, and it has no closed form
for this shape.

The potential is the panel, in volts. What a picture of it shows is where the current is going.

| Scene | What it shows |
| --- | --- |
| `12-winding-heats-a-motor` | The same motor as `11`, with the watts **computed** instead of stated: 62 m of 0.35 mm² copper at 1.75 A |

`11` says 12 W. This one derives 11.93 W from a length of wire, and the two settle within a
fifth of a kelvin of each other — so the guess was a good one, and this scene is what would have
caught it if it had not been. A stated number cannot be wrong, which is another way of saying it
is not a model.

Evaluated at 90 °C, which is worth 27.5%: copper gains 0.393% per kelvin, so the same coil on a
cold bench dissipates 9.35 W. The temperature is a parameter rather than an omission, and it is
one the *simulation* does not set — a domain cannot read another's state inside the step loop,
so closing that feedback is the caller's job and `pantometry-electrical` says why.

| Scene | What it shows |
| --- | --- |
| `13-winding-that-heats-itself` | The same coil with `tracks` set: its resistance follows its own temperature, so it settles 16 K hotter than one held at ambient |

**The only place in this repository where two domains are coupled by hand**, and it is worth
saying why that is allowed. Domains never read each other *inside* the step loop — they meet on
the bus, which carries amounts and not state. This runs between frames, in the code that owns
the simulation. It needed `Simulation::domain_as_mut`, which did not exist: a caller could read a
domain and not write one, so this loop was closable from nowhere at all. FRICTION 18.

The amplification is `1/(1 − g)` with `g = I²R₂₀·α·R_th`, and the test checks it as a ratio
against the same scene with `tracks` removed. Measured 1.281. Convection alone predicts 1.310;
the housing's linearised radiative conductance at 74.6 °C is 0.036 W/K against 0.294 for
convection, and including it gives 1.280 — so the 2.2% gap is radiation stiffening the heat path,
not error.

## A world — four crates at once

| Scene | What it shows |
| --- | --- |
| `14-a-world` | A laser and a lamp both heating one bar, sound crossing a room, three planets orbiting. Five domains, one clock, one bus, one audit at 1e-9 |

Every other scene here is one physics, or two meeting. This is the first with more than two, and
it exists because the crate split's claim is that domains *compose* — a claim verified in pairs
and never beyond. Building it found two things pairwise coupling cannot reach.

**A second consumer of one channel silently got nothing.** `Exchange::take` empties a channel, so
the second domain to take gets zero while every total agrees, because everything published was
consumed. Two plates under one lamp warm at the rate of one plate. That is refused now, and it
had been in every released version.

**A world's tolerance is set by its loosest domain.** The first attempt included the atom box,
which runs at 5e-2 over six picoseconds; the rest of this scene holds 1e-9 over 0.2 seconds.
Those are not reconcilable, and that is physics rather than a defect — a Lennard-Jones fluid and
a planetary orbit do not share a clock. "Physics for simulated worlds" means *a* world, not all
of them at once.

Two consequences that shape any scene like this. Declaration order is execution order, so a
producer declared after its consumer publishes into a step that has already taken — the audit
catches it as *published but not consumed*, which is how the lamp got moved above the bar. And
the plain channel is a single global resource: many producers may write to it, exactly one domain
may consume it.

## Motion — `pantometry-mechanics`

| Scene | What it shows |
| --- | --- |
| `06-orbits` | Four satellites on circular orbits round one mass, each tilted out of the reference plane. The inner ones lap the outer ones, which is Kepler's third law drawn rather than asserted |
| `07-bouncing-ball` | A penalty contact with a dashpot, losing height each bounce — and a thermal lump taking the joules it dissipates |

`07` needs that lump. Without a consumer the contact publishes heat that arrives nowhere and
the kernel refuses the step, which is correct and is worth seeing once.

## Matter — `pantometry-molecular`

| Scene | What it shows |
| --- | --- |
| `08-atoms-crystal` | 108 atoms at `T* = 0.15`: still on their lattice sites, rattling in place |
| `09-atoms-liquid` | The same 108 at `T* = 1.4`: the lattice is gone and they wander |

Same seed, same density, same box — only the temperature differs, so the two pictures side by
side are melting. The periodic cell is drawn as a wireframe, because it is a real boundary
rather than the edge of a picture.

## Light — `pantometry-optics`

| Scene | What it shows |
| --- | --- |
| `10-lamp-on-a-mirror` | A 100 W tungsten lamp on an aluminium mirror. The mirror is worse in the blue, so the lamp's *colour* decides how much becomes heat |

`pantometry-optics` has no `Domain` in it — spectra and Fresnel coefficients answer questions
rather than march a state — so this one is written in the application, like the heater and the
beam. A flat reflectance would make the colour temperature irrelevant and the whole spectral
apparatus an expensive way to multiply by a constant, which is why the test compares 2800 K
against 6500 K rather than checking one number.

## Every one of them is run by CI

A scene in this repository is a claim, and one that parses and then produces nonsense is worse
than none at all. `tests/scene.rs` runs all twenty-eight on every commit and asserts one number each —
chosen to be a property of the physics rather than of the file, so it would change if the
library broke and not merely if the scene were edited. Adding a scene without a claim fails
the test rather than passing quietly. CI also runs the real binary on the real files, which is
what a reader will type.

Running a scene is not a weak check on its own: the conservation audit is live for the whole
run, so one that leaked energy, created it, or left it unclaimed on a channel fails before it
draws anything.

## Three numbers that look wrong and are not

**A room is not quite the size you asked for.** `Room::of_air` quantises the height to a whole
number of cells so they stay square and the stability limit stays isotropic. A 3.1 m room at 81
cells across is 3.08 m tall, and its (1,1) mode is 67.97 Hz rather than the 67.67 Hz the
nominal dimensions predict.

**The bar's peak is not its mean.** In `04`, six joules raise 20 mm of aluminium by 1.240 K on
average, but the peak reads 1.302 K after four seconds. Heat arriving on a plain channel has no
place, so `Bar1D` puts it in the first cell and conduction has not finished levelling it.

**A bar's panel is in kelvin and its readings are in celsius**, and both say which. The field
returns what the cells hold; celsius is a conversion a view chooses, and no view here makes it.
So `04` prints `|K| 294.4821` for a bar whose hottest cell is at 21.33 °C. It said `|C| 21.3321` while this
application sampled fields itself and applied the offset in the same expression as the label —
which meant nothing could disagree with anything. `FRICTION.md` 22 is that gap, still open.

**The bouncing ball ends at zero.** `07` prints the last frame, and by one second the ball has
stopped. The bounces are in the middle of the strip, not at its end.

## Three dimensions

The physics always had them: `NBody`, `ContactSystem` and `Fluid` all carry `DVec3`, and
flattening to a plane was the renderer's simplification rather than the simulation's. Bodies
are drawn in an axonometric projection now, sorted back to front, with radius growing toward
the viewer and colour mixed toward the plate for distance. Without all three the picture is
flat however true the coordinates are.

Not isometric, deliberately: a true isometric view puts the axes at 120 degrees and makes a
cube ambiguous, which is a bad way to read a periodic box. Rooms and bars stay as they are —
`Room` is two-dimensional by construction, and the crate says why: a third dimension costs a
factor of √3 in the stability limit as well as the obvious one in cells.
