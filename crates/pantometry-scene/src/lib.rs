//! Where simulated things are, and what a run of them looks like.
//!
//! The middle layer. [`pantometry-core`](https://docs.rs/pantometry-core) says what evolves and what it
//! conserves; a view says how to draw it; this says **where things sit and what shape their
//! output is**.
//!
//! # It knows no physics, and that is the point
//!
//! Nothing here names a domain. It asks each one what it offers —
//! [`as_field`](pantometry_core::Domain::as_field) for a continuum,
//! [`as_bodies`](pantometry_core::Domain::as_bodies) for a countable set,
//! [`readings`](pantometry_core::Domain::readings) for scalars — and builds a [`Frame`] from the
//! answers. A physics that arrives tomorrow gets captured without this crate being edited, which
//! is the property the whole workspace is arranged around.
//!
//! That was not free. Pulling this layer out of the application found three places where it had
//! been matching on domain types instead: one for scalars, one for bodies, one for a field's
//! extent. The first two became trait methods on `Domain`. The third became [`Placement`].
//!
//! Knowing no physics does not make a layer complete, and this one was not. [`Extent`] described
//! a *plane* until a domain with a genuinely three-dimensional field arrived, and the gap did not
//! announce itself: the sampler built its position as `(u, v, 0)`, so a solid would have been
//! captured as its `z = 0` face and drawn as a perfectly plausible picture of a block. Nothing
//! here could have caught that, because every field this crate had ever been handed was flat. The
//! lesson is not about `Extent` — it is that a layer's assumptions are only visible from below.
//!
//! # Two kinds of placement, and why they are one type with two fields
//!
//! A [`Pose`] changes what the physics computes: two solids in contact, a grid rotated against
//! its neighbour. It lives in the kernel because physics needs it.
//!
//! A [`Placement::marker`] is a position handed to something that *has* no geometry, purely so a
//! viewer can put it somewhere. A thermal network node has a capacity and not a position, and a
//! conductance is not a distance — giving one a coordinate is a statement about a diagram.
//!
//! They are separated by **which crate they live in**, not by a naming convention. `Pose` is
//! below; `marker` is here, above every domain, where no physics can reach it. If they shared a
//! home a drawing coordinate would eventually arrive in a conductance and nothing would fail
//! loudly.
