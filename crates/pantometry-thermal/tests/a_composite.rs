//! A mixture's conductivity bounds, against a resolved geometry that attains them.
//!
//! `Mix::conductivity_bounds` returns two numbers and claims they bracket every microstructure. That is
//! a theorem and it would be worth nothing here unresolved, because the interesting property of Voigt
//! and Reuss is not that they bound but that they are **attained** — there exist real arrangements of
//! the same two materials that hit each end exactly. If they were merely bounds a caller could treat
//! the midpoint as "roughly right"; because they are attained, the midpoint is roughly right for
//! nothing in particular.
//!
//! The witness is a laminate, and the sharp form of the demonstration is that **one block gives both
//! answers**. Alternating layers of aluminium and borosilicate:
//!
//! ```text
//!   flux across the layers   ->  Reuss exactly    2.2132 W/m/K
//!   flux along  the layers   ->  Voigt exactly   84.0570 W/m/K
//! ```
//!
//! Same material, same volume fractions, same block. A factor of 38 apart, decided by the direction the
//! heat is going. That is the whole argument for `Mix` reporting a pair and refusing to pick.
//!
//! # Why this is not comparing two implementations of one idea
//!
//! `Mix` does algebra on volume fractions and knows nothing about grids. `Solid3D` solves conduction on
//! a resolved geometry and knows nothing about mixture rules — it is told which cell is which material
//! and takes harmonic means on faces because that is what a series resistance is. The agreement is
//! between an algebraic bound and a solved field, and the *reason* they agree is a theorem about
//! laminates that neither of them contains.
//!
//! The third test is the one that makes the pair mean something: a 3D checkerboard is isotropic by
//! symmetry, and it lands strictly between the two — and inside the tighter Hashin–Shtrikman pair,
//! which is what HS is for and which the laminate itself violates.

/// **A microstructure that is neither direction of the laminate lands strictly inside both bounds.**
///
/// This is what makes the pair mean something. The laminate tests show the ends are reachable; this shows
/// that an arrangement which is neither is genuinely between them, so `Mix` returning a range is
/// describing a real spread of achievable values rather than hedging.
///
/// A three-dimensional checkerboard is the arrangement, because it is cubic-symmetric and therefore has
/// an isotropic effective conductivity — measured, `kx` and `kz` agree exactly. The two marches are
/// mirror images of each other, so that agreement checks that x-faces and z-faces are treated alike and
/// says nothing about whether either march converged; that is the stopping rule's job. Its value has no closed
/// form, so the claim is the bracketing: inside `[Reuss, Voigt]`, which is a theorem for any
/// microstructure whatever, and **strictly** inside, because landing on a bound would mean the geometry
/// was secretly a laminate.
///
/// # Two things this test had to learn, and both are about resolution rather than physics
///
/// **A checkerboard one cell per phase is not a checkerboard.** Every cell then has all six neighbours of
/// the other material, so every face in the grid is an interface carrying the same harmonic mean, and the
/// discrete operator is exactly that of a *uniform* medium at `harmonic(167, 1.114) = 2.213236` — which at
/// equal volume fractions is the Reuss bound to the last digit. The microstructure sits at the grid scale,
/// so it is aliased rather than resolved, and the answer would be the same for any arrangement with no
/// same-material faces. Asserted below rather than avoided, so it is not rediscovered.
///
/// **A coarsely resolved high-contrast composite is under-conductive by enough to break a bound.** At a
/// fixed microstructure of four blocks per axis, refining the grid gives
///
/// ```text
///   2 cells/block   3.4926     below HS− = 4.3266
///   4 cells/block   5.1396     above
///   8 cells/block   6.8213     above, and still climbing 33% per doubling
/// ```
///
/// so the two-cell case violates the Hashin–Shtrikman lower bound — not because a checkerboard does, but
/// because two cells cannot represent one. The sequence has not converged at 32³ and the continuum value
/// is not reachable at this cost: with a 150-fold conductivity contrast the explicit step is set by the
/// aluminium and the settling time by the glass, so the step count runs as `N²·α_al/α_eff`. The same
/// pattern in stainless against aluminium, a 10-fold contrast, does the same thing — 39.57, 48.38, 54.10 —
/// which is what says it is the discretisation and not the pair.
///
/// So the HS pair is checked only where the microstructure is resolved, and the *direction* of the
/// remaining error is asserted instead of a value: refining raises the answer. That is a more robust
/// statement than any single number here would be, and it is the one that would catch a scheme that
/// converged the wrong way.
