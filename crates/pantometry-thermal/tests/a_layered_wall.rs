//! A block of more than one material, against the resistances its layers add up to.
//!
//! `Solid3D` was one material for ten domains' worth of history, and [`Solid3D::fill`] is the
//! second half of it rather than a new physics: the same `ρc ∂T/∂t = ∇·(k∇T)`, with `k` and `ρc`
//! allowed to vary from cell to cell. Nothing above the crate changed and the kernel did not.
//!
//! # What is worth checking, and it is one number
//!
//! Heat crosses a **face**, and a face has two materials touching it. The half cell either side is
//! a resistance in series, so the conductivity that governs the face is the harmonic mean
//! `2k_Lk_R/(k_L+k_R)` — and the arithmetic mean is not a coarser convention, it is a short circuit.
//! For aluminium against borosilicate the two are 2.21 and 84.1 W/m/K, a factor of 38.
//!
//! The harmonic mean earns an **equality**, not a tolerance. With the material interface on a cell
//! face, the discrete chain of face resistances is exactly `Σ Lᵢ/(kᵢA)` at every resolution: the
//! interface face contributes `1/(2k_L) + 1/(2k_R)` per unit length, which is precisely the two
//! half cells it stands for. So there is no discretisation error in a layered wall's resistance at
//! all, and the arithmetic mean's is first order — 8.9% at twelve cells, 1.0% at ninety-six, and
//! about a thousand cells to reach in 0.1% what harmonic has at three.
//!
//! # The stability limit stopped being a material property
//!
//! `max_stable_dt` sums the actual face conductances now instead of dividing by a diffusivity, and
//! that changed two answers. A block one cell thick across two axes reports `dx²/(2α)` — a bar's
//! limit, which is what that block is, where it used to report `dx²/(6α)` and cost three times the
//! steps. And a filled block is limited by its worst **cell**, which is usually far looser than its
//! fastest material: one aluminium cell inside borosilicate is stable at 75× aluminium's own
//! `dx²/(6α)`, because heat cannot arrive at a cell faster than its worst face delivers it.
