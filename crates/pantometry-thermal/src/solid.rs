//! Conduction through a block, in three dimensions.
//!
//! [`Bar1D`](crate::Bar1D) resolves a gradient along one axis, and that is the right model for a
//! rod, a wall or a beam landing on a strip. A heat sink is not any of those. Heat spreading
//! sideways out of a hot spot is exactly what a fin, a spreader plate and a mounting boss are
//! *for*, and a one-dimensional model cannot show it: it has nowhere for the heat to go but
//! along.
//!
//! # What the third dimension costs
//!
//! Twice, and the second time is the one that hurts.
//!
//! A block of `n` cells on a side is `n³` cells rather than `n`. And the explicit stability
//! limit tightens with each axis, because the limit is on the *sum* of what the three
//! directions do in one step:
//!
//! ```text
//!   1D      α·dt/dx² ≤ 1/2
//!   2D      α·dt/dx² ≤ 1/4
//!   3D      α·dt/dx² ≤ 1/6
//! ```
//!
//! So a 3D block at the same spacing takes three times as many steps as a bar, each of them n²
//! times more work. `Room` in `pantometry-acoustic` records the same trade for the wave equation and
//! reaches a factor of √3 rather than 3, because a wave's limit is on the wave speed and a
//! diffusion limit is on the diffusivity — one is linear in the sum and the other in its square
//! root.
//!
//! That is why [`LumpedMass`](crate::LumpedMass) and [`ThermalNetwork`](crate::ThermalNetwork)
//! are not going anywhere. In aluminium at a millimetre the step is **2.41 ms**, so a motor
//! housing over its two-thousand-second thermal time constant is **828,000 steps** — each of
//! them a sweep over however many cells the housing is, which at that spacing is around a
//! million. A graph of four nodes answers the same question immediately. Use the cheapest model
//! whose reduction still holds, and `LumpedMass::biot_number` is how you find out whether it
//! does.
//!
//! What a block is *for* is the case where the reduction does not hold: a hot spot, a spreader,
//! a gradient across a joint. Those are questions a lumped model cannot answer at any price.
//!
//! # What it is checked against
//!
//! A separable cosine mode is an **exact eigenvector of the discrete operator**, not merely an
//! approximate solution of the continuum one. On a cell-centred grid with insulated faces the
//! mode `cos(aπ(i+½)/nx)·cos(bπ(j+½)/ny)·cos(cπ(k+½)/nz)` decays by exactly the same factor
//! every step, and that factor is known in closed form. So the test is an equality at machine
//! precision rather than a tolerance, and it is sensitive to a swapped axis, a dropped term or a
//! wrong spacing in a way a smooth decaying blob would not be.
//!
//! The *continuum* rate is then a second test: the discrete eigenvalue approaches
//! `−α·π²·(1/Lx² + 1/Ly² + 1/Lz²)` at second order, and refining the grid quarters the error.
//! Rate rather than value, because a scheme that is first order where it claims to be second is
//! the defect this workspace has already shipped once.
//!
//! # A workaround that is gone
//!
//! This domain briefly offered `Domain::as_bodies` alongside `as_field`, so a viewer could get
//! its cells as a point cloud. That was not a design choice; it was cover for `pantometry-scene`'s
//! `Extent` being two-dimensional, which would have captured a block as its `z = 0` face.
//!
//! `Extent` is three-dimensional now, so the cover is unnecessary — and it was never free. A
//! domain that is two shapes at once makes the picture depend on whether somebody remembered to
//! set an extent, which is a mode nothing announces. It is a field, and only a field.
