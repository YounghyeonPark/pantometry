//! A lumped thermal network: n nodes, conductances between them, one domain.
//!
//! # Why this and not two coupled `LumpedMass` domains
//!
//! The standard electromechanical model is **junction → case → ambient**: a winding that gets
//! hot, a housing it conducts into, and a room the housing loses to. That is the model that
//! answers "will the winding survive", which is usually the only thermal question that matters.
//!
//! It cannot be built out of two [`LumpedMass`](crate::LumpedMass) domains, and the reason is
//! structural rather than an omission. A conductance carries `UA·(T₁ − T₂)`: it needs **both**
//! temperatures. Domains in this workspace never read each other — they meet on an
//! [`Exchange`], which carries *amounts* and not state, so neither side
//! can publish a temperature and neither can compute the flux alone. Any `conducting_to(peer)`
//! would have to break the property the rest of the design rests on.
//!
//! So the network is **one domain holding many nodes**, which is also what a thermal network
//! physically is: a single coupled system of ODEs, not independent bodies posting parcels to
//! each other. One `ledger()`, one stability limit, and the conservation audit unchanged.
//!
//! It buys something [`Bar1D`](crate::Bar1D) cannot express either — a **contact** resistance
//! between different materials. A bolted joint or a winding pressed into a stator is not bulk
//! conduction through one substance, and modelling it on a uniform grid needs a fictitious
//! conductivity standing in for the real interface.
//!
//! # What the audit cannot see here, and what covers it instead
//!
//! A link contributes `+q` to one node and `−q` to another **in the same sum**. They cancel
//! identically, so the ledger is blind to links by construction: a sign error, a transposed
//! index or a link dropped altogether passes the conservation audit at machine precision.
//!
//! That is not a gap in the kernel — [`audit_transfers`](pantometry_core::Exchange::audit_transfers)
//! covers transfers *between* domains and this one is inside a domain — but it decides how the
//! tests are written. Every link check is per node or on a closed form, never on the total. It
//! is the same lesson as the per-face audit in space and the substep share in time, arriving a
//! third time.
//!
//! It also decided the API. A node is addressed by a [`Node`] handle rather than by name,
//! because a link naming a node that does not exist would be exactly the invisible case above:
//! the books balance, the winding runs hot forever, and the number is plausible. A handle can
//! only come from [`ThermalNetwork::node`], so a dangling reference is not representable.
//! Names still exist — every node carries a label, and [`ThermalNetwork::node_named`] is the
//! bridge for a caller building from a file, where the resolver is a fifteen-line loop that can
//! name the file's own vocabulary in its error.
