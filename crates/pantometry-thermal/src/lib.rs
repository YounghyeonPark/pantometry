//! pantometry-thermal: heat, as a domain built on the `pantometry-core` kernel.
//!
//! Four domains, spanning three dimensionalities and one graph. The first two sit either side of
//! the line that matters to a scheduler:
//!
//! - [`LumpedMass`] has one temperature and no internal structure. Its stability
//!   limit is its own time constant, which is seconds for a piece of glass in still
//!   air — so it takes one step per frame and costs nothing.
//! - [`Bar1D`] resolves a gradient on a grid, and pays the explicit diffusion limit
//!   `dt < dx²/2α` for it. On a millimetre grid that is about a second in N-BK7 and
//!   seven milliseconds in aluminium, and *that* two-orders-of-magnitude gap between
//!   two parts of the same instrument is what
//!   [`Schedule::Multirate`](pantometry_core::Schedule::Multirate) exists for.
//!
//! The third answers a different question. Both of the above report *one* body:
//!
//! - [`ThermalNetwork`] is n lumped bodies joined by conductances — winding, stator,
//!   housing — and it carries the **drop across each joint**, which is the number a
//!   designer actually needs and the one a single lumped mass cannot give: it reports
//!   the temperature of the skin and the winding together. It also expresses a *contact*
//!   resistance between different materials, which [`Bar1D`]'s uniform grid cannot.
//!   A network of one node reduces to a [`LumpedMass`] bit for bit, so it inherits every
//!   check that domain already passes.
//!
//! And the fourth resolves what a bar cannot:
//!
//! - [`Solid3D`] is conduction in three dimensions on a cubic grid, which is what a hot spot
//!   needs: heat spreading *sideways* out of a spot is the whole job of a spreader plate and a
//!   fin, and a one-dimensional model has nowhere for it to go but along. It pays `dx²/6α`,
//!   a third of [`Bar1D`]'s limit, because the explicit limit tightens with every axis.
//!
//! # Where the heat comes from
//!
//! Neither domain generates any. They consume [`HEAT`] from the kernel's
//! [`Exchange`], and the thing that publishes it is optics:
//! `SurfaceOptics::absorptance` against a `SpectralPower` is a definite number of
//! watts, and those watts have to go somewhere. That is the whole coupling, and it
//! is auditable because it goes over the bus.
//!
//! # What is deliberately simple
//!
//! Both domains are explicit and both are linear in temperature except for the
//! radiative term. There is no implicit solver, no mesh, no natural convection
//! model — a convective loss is a coefficient the caller supplies, because
//! computing one honestly means solving a fluid problem and that is a different
//! crate. The point here is a domain that couples correctly and reports its own
//! stability limit, not a competitive thermal solver.

// Every public item carries a doc comment. Denied rather than warned: a public physics API
// whose `Length::mm` shows a blank summary in rustdoc is documented in the sense that a
// paragraph exists somewhere, and not in the sense a reader needs.

/// # The bar lies along x, and is uniform in y and z

/// value is held constant, which is not a fudge: the ends are insulated, so the temperature
/// really does stop changing there. Off-axis it is uniform, which is not an approximation
/// being hidden either — a one-dimensional model *is* the claim that nothing varies across
/// the bar, and [`LumpedMass::biot_number`] is where you check whether that claim holds.
///
/// # `at` ignores the time it is given, and that is the interface's one rough edge
///
/// [`ScalarField::at`] takes a [`Time`], because a closed-form field like
/// [`Motion`](pantometry_core::Motion) can answer for any instant. A marched domain cannot: it
/// holds *now* and nothing else. So the argument is ignored here, and a caller wanting a
/// different instant has to have recorded one.
///
/// The default [`ScalarField::rate`] would then read zero — it differences `at` across two
/// times — which would be wrong rather than merely unavailable, since the bar is visibly
/// heating. It is overridden below, and the fix is not a workaround: a diffusive field's
/// time derivative *is* `α∇²T`, so the governing equation supplies from the present state
/// exactly what the finite difference wanted history for.
///
/// # The derivatives use the domain's own stencil
///
/// [`ScalarField`] offers central differences over a step you choose, and its documentation
/// says a field that knows better should override them. This one does: `gradient` and
/// `laplacian` use the same mirrored three-point stencil that [`Domain::step`] integrates,
/// evaluated on the cells rather than by re-sampling the interpolated field. So the field
/// reports what the domain actually believes, and the `h` argument is ignored — asking for
/// a derivative on a scale finer than `dx` is asking for information the bar does not have.
///
/// They have to come from the cells rather than from `at`, and the reason is worth stating:
/// `at` interpolates linearly, so its exact second derivative is zero between nodes and
/// infinite at them. A Laplacian read off the interpolant would be useless. The cost is that
