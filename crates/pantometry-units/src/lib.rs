//! Dimensional analysis: physical quantities that refuse to be added wrongly.
//!
//! ```
//! use pantometry_units::{Area, Energy, Length, Mass, Power, SpecificHeat, Temperature, Time};
//!
//! // A unit-bearing constructor is the only place a factor of a thousand may appear.
//! let side = Length::mm(10.0);
//! let area: Area = side * side;                       // the dimension follows the product
//! assert!((area.to_si() - 1e-4).abs() < 1e-18);
//!
//! // Absorbed power over a time is an energy, and the type says so without being told.

//! let rise: Temperature = heat / capacity;
//! assert!((rise.to_si() - 0.05594).abs() < 1e-4);
//! ```
//!
//! And the mistake the whole crate exists to prevent does not compile:
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! use pantometry_units::{Length, Time};
//! let nonsense = Length::mm(3.0) + Time::s(1.0);
//! ```
//!
//! One domain can get away with a convention. `pantometry-core` began as optics and
//! said "millimetres, nanometres and seconds, everywhere" in a doc comment, and
//! that held because every number in the crate was a length, a wavelength or a
//! fraction. It stops holding the moment a second domain arrives: a kelvin, a
//! newton and a watt are all `f64`, they all add, and the compiler and the tests
//! both stay green while the physics goes wrong.
//!
//! So dimension lives in the type. [`Qty`] carries the seven SI base exponents as
//! const generic parameters, which makes `Length + Time` a compile error and
//! `Force * Length` an [`Energy`] — and costs nothing at runtime, since a `Qty`
//! is an `f64` and every operation on it is the `f64` operation.
//!
//! # Storage is always SI base units
//!
//! A `Qty` holds metres, kilograms, seconds, amperes, kelvin, moles, candela —
//! never millimetres, never nanometres. Those are *entry and exit* forms:
//!
//! ```
//! use pantometry_units::{Length, Time, Velocity};
//!
//! let d = Length::mm(120.0);
//! let t = Time::ms(4.0);
//! let v: Velocity = d / t;
//! assert!((v.to_si() - 30.0).abs() < 1e-12);   // 30 m/s
//! assert!((d.in_nm() - 1.2e8).abs() < 1.0);
//! ```
//!
//! That way there is exactly one representation to reason about, and the
//! unit-bearing constructors are the only place a factor of 1000 can hide.
//!
//! # What this cannot do
//!
//! **Angles are dimensionless**, so [`Frequency`] and an angular velocity are the
//! same type — SI says radians are m/m, and no dimensional system can separate
//! them. Same for torque and energy. Where that distinction matters, it has to be
//! carried by a newtype in the domain crate, not here.
//!
//! **Only declared products compose.** `Length * Length` is an [`Area`] because
//! that pair is written down below. Deriving arbitrary products would need
//! arithmetic on const generic parameters, which is unstable, so the alternative
//! to a declared list is a dependency on `uom`. The list is cheap to extend, and
//! anything undeclared can always go through [`Qty::from_si`].

// Every public item carries a doc comment. Denied rather than warned: a public physics API
// whose `Length::mm` shows a blank summary in rustdoc is documented in the sense that a
// paragraph exists somewhere, and not in the sense a reader needs.
