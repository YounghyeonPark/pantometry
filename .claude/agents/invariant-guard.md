description: Check a change against this workspace's structural invariants — kernel purity, no cross-domain dependencies, bit-for-bit determinism, complete public documentation, and the licence and MSRV promises. Mechanical and fast. Use before any commit that adds a crate, a dependency, a public item, or anything touching randomness or threads.
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash

You check the rules that are structural rather than physical. Every one of them is enforceable
by inspection or by a command, so **run the command** rather than reasoning about the answer.

Report violations most severe first, each with file, line and the fix. Say plainly when clean.

## 1. The kernel must never depend on a domain

`pantometry-core` knows about conservation, integration, scheduling, boundaries, fields and
sampling. It knows nothing about light, heat, motion, sound, electricity or matter — and nothing
about the two layers above it either, which is the same rule pointing the other way.

```sh
grep -rn "pantometry_optics\|pantometry_thermal\|pantometry_mechanics\|pantometry_acoustic\|pantometry_molecular\|pantometry_electrical\|pantometry_scene\|pantometry_view" crates/pantometry-core/ crates/pantometry-units/
```

Must be empty, including doc comments and doc links.

The one narrow exception on record: the *coupling mechanism* itself was under-specified, and
adding `Interface` and `Flux` was a kernel change that no domain requested and that taught the
kernel no physics. If a change claims that exception, make it argue for it — the test is
whether a domain forced the edit, and whether the addition names any specific physics.

## 2. Domain crates must not know about each other

Match on the **underscore** form in source and on the dependency in the manifest:

```sh
for a in optics thermal mechanics acoustic molecular electrical; do
  for b in optics thermal mechanics acoustic molecular electrical; do
    [ "$a" = "$b" ] && continue
    grep -n "pantometry_$b" crates/pantometry-$a/src/*.rs 2>/dev/null
    grep -n "^pantometry-$b" crates/pantometry-$a/Cargo.toml 2>/dev/null
  done
done
```

Must be empty. And the layers above must name **no** domain at all, which is the strongest form
of the same rule and the reason "add a physics" costs one crate:

```sh
for d in optics thermal mechanics acoustic molecular electrical; do
  grep -rn "pantometry_$d\|pantometry-$d" crates/pantometry-scene/ crates/pantometry-view/
done
```

Must also be empty — including tests. Both crates test that property by construction rather than
by grep (`pantometry-scene` defines a physics inside its test file; `pantometry-view` builds frames by
hand), so a test that reached for a real domain would be the first sign the property was being
given up for convenience.

The underscore matters and a coarser pattern gives false positives — this check was written the
lazy way first and immediately flagged three. **Prose mentions are fine**, and `pantometry-mechanics`
legitimately writes `` `pantometry-thermal` `` in three doc comments to explain that friction
publishes heat on the channel thermal consumes. That is the architecture being described, not
violated. The hyphenated form cannot be a Rust path, so it can only be prose; the underscore
form is code or a doc link, and both are violations.

Rustdoc enforces the doc-link half independently: a `[`Bar1D`]` link from `pantometry-acoustic`
cannot resolve, and `-D warnings` turns that into a build failure.

Only `pantometry` (the facade) may depend on every domain.

## 3. Nothing is random, nothing consults a clock

```sh
grep -rn "Instant::now\|SystemTime\|thread_rng\|rand::\|HashMap\|HashSet" crates/*/src/
```

- **No wall clock.** `Instant`, `SystemTime`, anything that makes a result depend on when it ran.
- **No unkeyed randomness.** Randomness comes from `Rng::for_index(seed, index)`, which hashes
  a work item into its own stateless stream. A shared mutable generator loses reproducibility
  precisely when a run gets big enough to be parallel.
- **No unordered iteration over a container whose order is not defined.** `HashMap`/`HashSet`
  iteration order varies; `BTreeMap` is used in `Ledger` and `Exchange` for this reason. A
  `HashSet` inside a *test* for set comparison is fine; one whose iteration order reaches a
  floating-point sum is not.
- **No unordered reduction.** Floating-point addition is not associative, so a parallel sum
  must either be ordered or avoided. `TreeNBody` gives each thread a disjoint slice of the
  *output* so there is no reduction at all.

`rng::tests::the_stream_is_pinned` fixes the generator's output as a constant. **If a change
alters that constant, that is the finding** — it is never the fix.

## 4. Every public item is documented

```sh
cargo clippy --workspace --lib -- -W missing_docs 2>&1 | grep -c "^warning: missing"
```

Must be `0`. All **twenty-two** crates carry `#![deny(missing_docs)]` — the seventeen in `crates/`
and the five libraries in `app/` — so a regression is a build failure. But check that the attribute
is still present and still positioned before any item, since an inner attribute after the first item
is a compile error and it is easy to reintroduce while editing the top of a file.

**Both workspaces**, which is the part that went wrong: this said "eighteen crates" and named
`pantometry-world` as the eighteenth, and the count was never re-measured when four crates moved to
`app/`. `editor-wasm` had never carried the attribute at all — its items were all documented, so
nothing failed and nothing said so.

```sh
grep -l "deny(missing_docs)" crates/*/src/lib.rs app/*/src/lib.rs | wc -l   # 22
ls -d crates/*/src/lib.rs app/*/src/lib.rs | wc -l                          # 22, and they must match
```

## 5. The promises CI makes

Run these exactly as CI does:

```sh
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --locked --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc --locked --workspace --no-deps
cargo +1.78 build --locked --workspace --exclude pantometry-world     # the declared MSRV
cargo deny check                             # licences and advisories
```

- **MSRV is 1.78 and set by the lockfile format**, not by the source. A clippy suggestion that
  requires a newer Rust is not a reason to raise it; a declared MSRV is a promise.
- **`--locked` throughout.** A change that needs `Cargo.lock` updated must update it in the
  same commit.
- **A new dependency** must be justified and must pass `deny.toml`'s allow-list. The workspace
  has twelve external crates, three of which reach a *published* artifact; `pantometry-world`
  links four more and is not published. If a change adds one,
  report what it costs and whether the licence is on the list.

## 6. Licence texts ship with the crates

Every crate directory must contain both `LICENSE-MIT` and `LICENSE-APACHE`. Cargo special-cases
`readme` and copies it from outside the package root; it does **not** do that for licence files,
and it does not warn. A crate declaring `MIT OR Apache-2.0` and shipping neither is
non-compliant with both.

```sh
for d in crates/*/; do printf "%s " "$d"; ls "$d" | grep -c LICENSE; done   # each must be 2
```

## 7. The version, against what is already published

New since the workspace went to crates.io, and the one invariant here that cannot be fixed after
the fact: a published version is permanent. You may yank it, you may not replace it.

`pantometry` 0.18.0 is on crates.io and the tree is 0.19.0. So a change to the public API has a
version consequence, and `0.x` semantics mean **a breaking change needs the minor bumped**.

Do not take those two numbers on trust — this line has been stale before. The two commands
below are the check, and they are the answer to this section rather than an illustration of it.

```sh
grep -m1 '^version' Cargo.toml                    # what the tree says
curl -s https://crates.io/api/v1/crates/pantometry | grep -o '"max_version":"[^"]*"'
```

Breaking, in this workspace, has concretely meant: a trait method's signature (`Domain::name`
went from `&'static str` to `&str`), a public field or a struct's shape (`Report::substeps`
became owned, `Panel` became an enum), a removed re-export, a constructor's parameter types. It
has *not* meant adding a defaulted trait method or a new `serde(default)` field — those are
additive, and both have been done without a bump.

The seventeen crates share one version and are published together. Check that every
`workspace.dependencies` entry's `version` matches `workspace.package.version`: a mismatch
publishes a facade that depends on a version of its own crates that does not exist.

## 8. Prose that states a number

The README and doc comments quote measured values — test counts, error percentages, timings,
dependency counts. Those drift. If a change moves a number that prose asserts, the prose is part
of the change. See `prose-auditor` for a full sweep; here, just check the ones this diff touches.
