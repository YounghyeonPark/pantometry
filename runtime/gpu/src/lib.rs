//! An accelerator for pantometry's explicit stencils, with the CPU domain as the reference.
//!
//! # The one rule
//!
//! **`Solid3D` is the answer and this is a cache of it.** Where the two disagree, the CPU is
//! right. That is not modesty — it is the only arrangement under which the library's promises
//! survive a GPU at all, and it is what makes the comparison in `tests/` the point of the crate
//! rather than a nicety.
//!
//! # Why a GPU port is a different computation, not a faster one
//!
//! WGSL has no `f64`. Every number below is `f32`, against the domain's `f64`, so this is not the
//! same arithmetic run quicker — it is a lower-precision arithmetic. `tests/against_the_cpu.rs`
//! measures how far apart they land rather than asserting they agree, and the figure it reports
//! is the honest cost of the acceleration.
//!
//! That has a consequence worth stating plainly: `Simulation`'s conservation audit defaults to a
//! relative `1e-9`, and single precision cannot hold that. A scene using this needs
//! `conservation_tolerance_for(quantity::ENERGY, ..)` set to something `f32` can meet, and
//! choosing that number is choosing what the run is allowed to lose.
//!
//! # What is on the GPU and what is deliberately not
//!
//! The **stencil** is: each cell reads six neighbours and writes itself, in no particular order,
//! which is exactly the shape a GPU is for and exactly the shape that has no ordering problem.
//!
//! The **reductions are not.** A mean or a total summed with atomics depends on the order the
//! workgroups happened to finish, and floating-point addition is not associative — so the answer
//! would change between runs on one machine. [`GpuSolid::ledger`] reads the grid back and sums it
//! on the CPU in index order. That costs a transfer per audited step and buys back the thing the
//! whole workspace is built on.
//!
//! `Ensemble` solved the same problem on threads with fixed-size blocks, and the same discipline
//! would work here. It is not done yet because a readback is simpler and correct, and a faster
//! deterministic reduction is worth writing when somebody's grid is large enough to need it.
//!
//! # The buffer holds the **deviation**, and that is not a detail
//!
//! Cells carry `T − T₀`, not `T`. The first version stored absolute kelvin and diverged from the
//! reference by `1.4e-3` after two hundred steps — a thousand times what accumulation predicts —
//! and the cause was not accumulation at all.
//!
//! The update is `centre + F·(sum − 6·centre)`. On absolute temperatures near 293 K that sum is
//! about 1759, where `f32`'s resolution is `1.2e-4`. The difference being extracted from it is of
//! order `1e-3` K. **Subtracting two numbers that agree to five digits keeps less than one digit
//! of the answer**, every step, forever.
//!
//! On deviations the same numbers are near 1 K, where the resolution is `1.2e-7`, and the
//! subtraction keeps about four digits. The stencil is linear, so subtracting a constant commutes
//! with it exactly and the fix costs nothing — which is the useful part: single precision was not
//! the problem, spending it on an offset nobody needed was.
