//! pantometry run scene.json out.html    # a report: a view per domain, chosen from its shape
//! pantometry run scene.json out.svg     # a filmstrip: every frame, one page, still
//! pantometry run scene.json out.csv     # every domain's scalars over time, one row per frame
//! pantometry run scene.json out.json    # the frames themselves — fields, bodies and readings
//! pantometry run scene.json out.usda    # the whole run as USD: geometry, colour and scalars,
//!                                       # animated, for usdview / Omniverse / Houdini / Maya
//! pantometry check s.json               # does it parse and build, without running it
//! pantometry emit s.json                # write the built-in scene out to start from
//! pantometry verify s.json              # the battery: margins, determinism, sweeps, geometry

//!
//! The spellings this took before the four binaries became one — `--check`, `--emit-default`, and a
//! bare scene path — still work, and `a_missing_file_says_which` checks both.
//!
//! `.html` is the one to reach for if you do not already know how you want this drawn. It picks
//! a view from each domain's *shape* — a profile for a 1D field, a heatmap for a 2D one, a
//! rotatable scene for bodies, a line chart for scalars — and opens in a browser with nothing
//! installed. `.csv` is the one that changed what this crate can say. **Twelve of the thirty**
//! shipped scenes have a domain the filmstrip cannot draw — measured by running each of them, not
//! counted once and left — and for several the scalar *is* the result:
//! scene 13's whole subject is a winding whose resistance follows its own temperature, and it
//! drew nothing at all.
