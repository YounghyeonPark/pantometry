//! A file this binary cannot read is named, and the naming is checked.
//!
//! The first thing a stranger typed at this binary was `pantometry run scene.json` in a directory
//! with no `scene.json`, and it answered
//!
//! ```text
//! Error: Os { code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: "The system cannot find the file specified." }
//! ```
//!
//! which is a complete diagnosis of the wrong question: it says what happened and not what it
//! happened to. Every other error this binary produces had carried its path for months — the
//! parse path even carries `file:line:column` — so the two halves of reading a file disagreed
//! about whether the reader deserved to know the file's name.
//!
//! These tests run the built binary rather than calling a function, because the defect was in
//! the seam between a `?` and `main`'s return type, and nothing below that seam could see it.
