//! The colours a run's temperatures are drawn in, checked without a window.
//!
//! The viewer learned this once already: a window nobody can photograph proves the program did
//! not panic, which is a much weaker claim than it looks. The editor's viewport paints a
//! temperature field in the colour Planck says that temperature is, and the claim worth pinning
//! is not that it painted *something* — it is that the colours are the ones physics computed and
//! that the fallback fires exactly when physics has no colour to give.
//!
//! These live here rather than in the shell because the shell is a window and this is
//! arithmetic. What the shell adds — a depth sort and a splat radius — is geometry that
//! `viewer-core`'s own tests already cover in the form that matters.

/// colour and says so on the canvas.
