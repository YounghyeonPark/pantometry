//! The `verify` verb: the measurements a passing audit does not make.
//!
//! Every entry in this battery exists because of an error this workspace actually shipped and
//! the audit passed. A 10 ms coupling window delivered exactly the right joules and read a peak
//! temperature 12% low; a wall-weighting defect sat inside a 1.4% error that looked like
//! discretisation until refinement *halved* it instead of quartering it; and a run that
//! reproduces bit for bit is a claim no other tool can check because no other stack is
//! deterministic. None of those is visible in one run — which is the point of this module: it
//! runs the scene **again**, differently, and reports what moved.
//!
//! What it measures:
//!
//! - **Margins, not verdicts.** The worst conservation drift per quantity against its
//!   tolerance, and each evolving domain's stability limit against the coupling window. A pass
//!   with no margin left is a different fact from a pass.
//! - **Determinism.** The same scene run twice must produce byte-identical frames. A digest
//!   over the run is printed so "this reproduces" is checkable rather than claimed.
//! - **Window sensitivity.** The scene rerun with the coupling window halved. What moves is
//!   the error the window was hiding — the one error class no conservation check can see,
//!   because a ledger has no representation for *when*.
//! - **Resolution sensitivity.** The scene rerun with every discretised domain refined 2×.
//!   What moves is discretisation error, measured rather than assumed.
//! - **Rasterisation loss.** What each designed part cost the grid it was rasterised onto, and
//!   a finding for the ones the grid could not hold. This is the only entry that needs no
//!   second run, and the only one whose subject has no symptom at all: a rib finer than the
//!   cell does not fail, it disappears. `--check` has printed the measurement since parts
//!   existed; a printed number is one somebody has to read, and this is the pass that reads it.
//!
//! `--deep` adds a third run to each sweep (window quartered, resolution 4×) and measures the
//! **order**: `p = log2(d1/d2)` where `d1` and `d2` are successive differences of the same
//! reading. A first-order coupling error reads `p ≈ 1`; a healthy second-order scheme reads
//! `p ≈ 2`; a second-order scheme with a first-order boundary reads between, falling toward 1
//! as the grid refines — which is exactly the signature that found both acoustic boundary
//! defects.
//!
//! # What the measured order actually is
//!
//! The order of the **reading**, sampling included — not of the scheme in the abstract. A peak
//! read at a cell centre moves with the cell, geometry quantised to a grid (a hall's ceiling, a
//! basket's radius) shifts by a fraction of a cell between resolutions, and both contaminate
//! the measurement toward first order. That is not a defect of the battery: the reading is what
//! a person believes, so its convergence is the one that matters. A contaminated order is a
//! true statement about the number being read.
//!
//! The **window** orders carry one more contaminant: a multirate domain's substep count is a
//! ceiling, so its inner step moves non-smoothly as the window halves, and a subcycled
//! domain's window order can read as almost anything small (a bar's peak measured 0.331 from
//! the ceiling alone). A window order means what it says for the quantities the *window*
//! governs — a coupling taken per frame, a feedback closed between frames — and the report
//! prints a reminder above those lines rather than leaving this paragraph to be found later.
//!
//! # What is refused rather than measured
//!
//! A refinement must state the **same physical problem** on a finer grid, and three things in
//! this format cannot: a [`HotSpot`](crate::HotSpot) is one cell, so refining halves its
//! physical size and divides its energy by eight; a [`DomainSpec::Conductor`]'s blocked cells
//! are one cell each, so a notch shrinks; and a channelled [`DomainSpec::Puck`]'s ring is one
//! cell wide by construction. Refining any of those would compare two different problems and
//! call the difference discretisation error, so the sweep is skipped and the report says which
//! domain and why — loudly, because a check that silently skipped is this workspace's oldest
//! failure shape.
