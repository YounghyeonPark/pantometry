//! the workspace, and a publisher that lives in this crate is the only way to find out
//! whether [`Domain`] can be implemented by a consumer without reaching for anything the
//! library keeps to itself. Every other domain in a scene so far was one the library already
//! provided, which tested the constructors and nothing else.
