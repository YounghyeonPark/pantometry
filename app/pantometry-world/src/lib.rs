//! A world described as data, run against the pantometry SDK, and drawn.

//! This is the workspace's first consumer, and its first job is not to be a good application.
//! It is to be an *outside* user of the library — one that reaches for the API the way a
//! stranger would rather than the way its author remembers it — and to write down every place
//! that turns out to be awkward. A library with no consumers is a library whose ergonomics
//! nobody has measured.
//!
//! Findings are collected in `FRICTION.md` beside this crate. Twenty-nine of the thirty-four are
//! fixed — this crate is the record of what the API was like before, and the reason it changed.
//! Both counts are under test now — `counts_in_prose.rs` walks seven places this number is
//! written and this line is one of them. It had been stale for two releases before it was.
//!
//! The layers it once carried are libraries now. `pantometry-scene` owns capture, and this crate is
//! left with what an *application* actually is: a file format, the domain types that format names,
//! and one place saying how far each field extends. A consumer that wants to draw a run no longer
//! has to reach into a binary that is `publish = false` to do it.
