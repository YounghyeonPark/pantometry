//! A source that heats *where it lands*, over a shared boundary.
//!
//! The spatial counterpart of [`Heater`](crate::heater::Heater), and the reason this file
//! exists separately: a plain channel carries an amount, and an [`Interface`] carries an
//! amount **and a place**. That distinction is the newest part of the kernel and had no
//! consumer outside the workspace until this crate grew one.
//!
//! # What a consumer has to get right, and what the kernel will not let it get wrong
//!
//! Both sides of a spatial coupling must agree on the boundary's *discretisation* — the same
//! name and the same number of faces. Nothing derives one from the other: the bar builds its
//! interface from its own cell count and this builds a matching one from the scene, so the
//! agreement is stated twice and could be stated inconsistently.
//!
//! It cannot be stated inconsistently *and get away with it*. [`Exchange::publish_on`] refuses
//! a flux whose face count differs from the interface's, and says both numbers. Silently
//! padding or truncating would put energy on the wrong part of the boundary, which is worse
//! than losing it — losing it the audit would catch on its own.
