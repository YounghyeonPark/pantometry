//! The report picks a view from the data's shape, for a researcher who should not have to.
//!
//! The claim is not that the pictures are pretty. It is that a run of *any* domain produces a
//! file that opens in a browser and shows something correct — without the caller knowing that a
//! bar wants a profile, a room wants a heatmap and a fluid wants a rotatable scene.

//! Driven from the shipped scenes rather than from hand-built frames, and it lives here rather
//! than in `pantometry-view` for that reason: the scenes are this crate's, and a view crate that
//! depended on an application to get something to draw would have the arrows pointing the wrong
//! way. `pantometry-view`'s own tests build their frames without any physics at all.
