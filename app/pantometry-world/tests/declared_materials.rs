//! A scene that brings its own materials.
//!
//! The catalogue holds nine substances and the world holds hundreds of thousands, so a format that can
//! only *name* a material can only ever describe nine kinds of thing. `Substance` has been
//! `Deserialize` all along; what was missing was a place in the file to put one.
//!
//! The physics of a declared substance is checked in `pantometry`'s `substances_from_a_file.rs`, against
//! Neumann's exact solution and beside ice through the same harness. This file is about the other half,
//! which is the half a format gets wrong: **what happens when the declaration is a mistake.**
//!
//! Three of them are refused, and the third is the one worth reading. `material` on a block is optional
//! and defaults to aluminium, so a scene that declares a substance and then does not name it — a field
//! left off, a name misspelled at the use site where the declaration is spelled right — runs as a block
//! of aluminium. It runs, it audits, it renders, and it answers a question about the wrong material
//! with nothing anywhere saying so. That is the same failure a region selecting no cells has, one level
//! up, and it gets the same treatment.
