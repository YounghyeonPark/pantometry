//! A scene can say where a part sits — and cannot say that two parts touch.
//!
//! `Pose` has been in the kernel since placement arrived, and no file could reach it: every
//! domain sat at the origin because the format had nowhere to say otherwise. `poses` is that
//! place. What it moves is where a domain is captured and drawn, through the kernel's rigid
//! motion, so distances and angles survive exactly.
//!
//! What it deliberately does not do is make placed parts interact, and the last two tests pin
//! that rather than leaving it to be discovered. Domains meet on the bus and over an
//! `Interface` matched by face count; no geometry is consulted anywhere, so parts drawn in
//! contact exchange nothing. `ARCHITECTURE.md` names that as the gap that arrives first in
//! practice, and placing is the half that can be done without answering the other half.
//!
//! Writing those tests turned up a second obstacle, larger and not in that list, and it is gone
//! now because of them: **two domains that consume the same channel could not share a scene at
//! all.** Two blocks with no heater anywhere were refused on the second one's first step,
//! because the kernel's guard counted takes rather than amounts and could not tell an empty
//! channel taken from twice from a full one. It asks what moved now — an earlier domain
//! received something and this one asked and got nothing because of it — so two parts coexist
//! and one lamp still cannot warm two plates at the rate of one.
