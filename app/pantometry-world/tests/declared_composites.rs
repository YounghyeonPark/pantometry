//! A scene that mixes its own materials.
//!
//! `declared_materials.rs` covers a scene bringing a substance. This covers the other half, which needed
//! `Mix` to exist: a scene bringing a **composite** — a motor that is copper, steel, magnets and air, a
//! board that is FR-4 and copper, a buffer that is wax in a metal matrix. Each wants to be one material a
//! coarse grid can hold, and its properties are not the properties of its main constituent.
//!
//! # What the format can check and what it cannot
//!
//! It cannot compute the conductivity. No single value exists for a composite without the microstructure,
//! and that is physics rather than a gap — a laminate of the same two materials in the same proportions
//! conducts 38 times more one way than the other.
//!
//! What it *can* do is refuse an impossible one, and the refusal is where the value is: a scene file has
//! nowhere else to learn what range is achievable, so the message carries the Voigt and Reuss bounds and
//! the tighter Hashin–Shtrikman pair. A caller who guessed is told the four numbers that matter.
//!
//! It cannot check the emissivity at all, because that is a property of the surface and a mixture has no
//! surface. A half-copper board is 0.05 bare and 0.9 under solder mask.
