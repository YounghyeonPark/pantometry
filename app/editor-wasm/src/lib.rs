//! The same editor machinery, compiled for a browser — no server, no bindings generator.
//!
//! The whole library compiles to `wasm32-unknown-unknown`: kernel, eleven domains, the scene
//! format, the builder and the view layer. So a scene can be checked, run, verified and drawn
//! entirely inside a page, and nothing here talks to a backend because there is nothing for a
//! backend to do. The physics that answers the question is the physics that shipped.
//!
//! # A second shell, not a second implementation
//!
//! Checking, placement geometry, running, verifying and the colour of a field's cells are
//! [`editor_core`]'s — the same machinery the native window uses and the same tests cover. The
//! camera and framing are `viewer-core`'s, as they are in the native shell and the HTML report.
//! What is only here is marshalling and one projection loop. That split is the reason this
//! crate is a workspace member beside `editor` rather than a workspace of its own: two shells
//! over one core is a structure, and two copies of a colour rule is a defect waiting.
//!
//! # Why raw exports rather than `wasm-bindgen`
//!
//! Because the whole surface is **text in, text out**: a scene is JSON, a run is JSON, a report
//! is a string. That needs one allocator pair and a length prefix, which is the code below, and
//! it costs the workspace no new dependency and the reader no new toolchain — `cargo build
//! --release -p editor-wasm --target wasm32-unknown-unknown` is the entire build. A bindings
//! generator earns its place when the boundary carries structs; this one carries bytes.
//!
//! # The contract with the page
//!
//! Every export returns a pointer to a **length-prefixed** buffer: four little-endian bytes of
//! length, then that many bytes of UTF-8. The page reads the length, decodes the body, then
//! calls [`pantometry_free`] with the pointer and `4 + length`. Every return is JSON, errors
//! included, so a caller has one shape to parse rather than two.

/// What the page keeps between calls, held here so a megabyte of frames does not cross the
/// boundary once per repaint.
